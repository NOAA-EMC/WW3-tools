Edit the file "makefile" and select the desired options:

# netcdf3: write netcdf files with netcdf-3 library
# netcdf4: write netcdf files with netcdf-4 library
# regex: regular expression package used by (match,not), POSIX-2
# tigge: enable -tigge option for tigge names
# mysql: write to mysql files
# ipolates: interpolation to new grids
#
# the flags are stored in wgrib2/config.h
#
USE_NETCDF4=1
USE_NETCDF3=0
USE_REGEX=1
USE_TIGGE=1
USE_MYSQL=0




On some machines, you will have to define the C compiler
and C preprocessor.  On the NCEP's AIX, I have to define
them by

	export CC=/usr/vacpp/bin/xlC_r
	export CPP=/usr/bin/cpp

Then you have to run gnu make.  (gmake on some machines, make on others)

	make		- on linux
	gmake		- on AIX
	


                        INSTALLING on windows XP

On the cygwin development system, you need to install many packages.
Please install the jasper library because the included jasper source
code has some problems compiling.  Once the makefile points to the
pre-compiled jasper headers/library, the code can be compiled.
See makefile_sys_jasper.


                        INSTALLING on FreeBSD

Try make



                        INSTALLING on Apple OS-X

Has been done. No details.


                        INSTALLING on AIX

Define CC and CPP environment variables. Use gmake
	export CC=/usr/vacpp/bin/xlC_r
	export CPP=/usr/bin/cpp


                        Optional Packages

You can edit the makefile to include optional packages.
1 means include the package and 0 means don't include the package.


                          Comments on Netcdf

The makefile is set up to use either netcdf v3 or netcdf v4.  Netcdf-4
makes wgrib2 much bigger, so don't install it unless you really have to.
The source code for netcdf-4 (and necessary hdf5) is also very big
and will have to be downloaded separately.

The netcdf-3 library is included with this distribution.  The library is 
compiled in enable-C-only mode which is not be that useful for 
fortran code.  Don't use try to link other codes to this library.

The netcdf-4 library has to be downloaded with the HDF5 library.  The
libraries are compiled in enable-C-only mode.

			Static vs Dynamic Libraries

The various libraries can be created in both dynamic and static versions.  
I've tried to make the add-on libraries static.  


                               Problems

Some optional packages require changes to makefile
