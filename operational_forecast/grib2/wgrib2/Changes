		new: 264:30420217:d=2004021912:TMIN:2 m above ground:66-72 hour fcst:

		    wrong, used 2's complement to store integer rather than signed number.
		    NCEP operations knows of the problem but can't fix it because of 
		    downstream software.
		changed -prob: prob>N to prob >N, prob<N prob <N, prob>N <N to prob =N
		-lev0 .. handle factions of a PV unit in control file
v0.1.7.8c  1/2009 (internal)
