<h2 class="unnumbered">Foreword</h2>

<p>Unidata (<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu</a>) is a National Science
Foundation-sponsored program empowering U.S. universities, through
innovative applications of computers and networks, to make the best
use of atmospheric and related data for enhancing education and
research. For analyzing and displaying such data, the Unidata Program
Center offers universities several supported software packages
developed by other organizations. Underlying these is a
Unidata-developed system for acquiring and managing data in real time,
making practical the Unidata principle that each university should
acquire and manage its own data holdings as local requirements
dictate. It is significant that the Unidata program has no data
center&ndash;the management of data is a "distributed" function.

   <p>The Network Common Data Form (netCDF) software described in this guide
was originally intended to provide a common data access method for the
various Unidata applications. These deal with a variety of data types
that encompass single-point observations, time series,
regularly-spaced grids, and satellite or radar images.

   <p>The netCDF software functions as an I/O library, callable from C,
FORTRAN, C++, Perl, or other language for which a netCDF library is
available. The library stores and retrieves data in self-describing,
machine-independent datasets. Each netCDF dataset can contain
multidimensional, named variables (with differing types that include
integers, reals, characters, bytes, etc.), and each variable may be
accompanied by ancillary data, such as units of measure or descriptive
text. The interface includes a method for appending data to existing
netCDF datasets in prescribed ways, functionality that is not unlike a
(fixed length) record structure. However, the netCDF library also
allows direct-access storage and retrieval of data by variable name
and index and therefore is useful only for disk-resident (or
memory-resident) datasets.

   <p>NetCDF access has been implemented in about half of Unidata's
software, so far, and it is planned that such commonality will extend
across all Unidata applications in order to:

     <ul>
<li>Facilitate the use of common datasets by distinct applications.

     <li>Permit datasets to be transported between or shared by dissimilar
computers transparently, i.e., without translation.

     <li>Reduce the programming effort usually spent interpreting formats.

     <li>Reduce errors arising from misinterpreting data and ancillary data.

     <li>Facilitate using output from one application as input to another.

     <li>Establish an interface standard which simplifies the inclusion of new
software into the Unidata system.

   </ul>

   <p>A measure of success has been achieved. NetCDF is now in use on
computing platforms that range from personal computers to
supercomputers and include most UNIX-based workstations. It can be
used to create a complex dataset on one computer (say in FORTRAN) and
retrieve that same self-describing dataset on another computer (say in
C) without intermediate translations&ndash;netCDF datasets can be
transferred across a network, or they can be accessed remotely using a
suitable network file system or remote access protocols.

   <p>Because we believe that the use of netCDF access in non-Unidata
software will benefit Unidata's primary constituency&ndash;such use may
result in more options for analyzing and displaying Unidata
information&ndash;the netCDF library is distributed without licensing or
other significant restrictions, and current versions can be obtained
via anonymous FTP. Apparently the software has been well received by a
wide range of institutions beyond the atmospheric science community,
and a substantial number of public domain and commercial data analysis
systems can now accept netCDF datasets as input.

   <p>Several organizations have adopted netCDF as a data access standard,
and there is an effort underway at the National Center for
Supercomputer Applications (NCSA, which is associated with the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) to support the netCDF
programming interfaces as a means to store and retrieve data in "HDF
files," i.e., in the format used by the popular NCSA tools. We have
encouraged and cooperated with these efforts.

   <p>Questions occasionally arise about the level of support provided for
the netCDF software. Unidata's formal position, stated in the
copyright notice which accompanies the netCDF library, is that the
software is provided "as is". In practice, the software is updated
from time to time, and Unidata intends to continue making improvements
for the foreseeable future. Because Unidata's mission is to serve
geoscientists at U.S. universities, problems reported by that
community necessarily receive the greatest attention.

   <p>We hope the reader will find the software useful and will give us
feedback on its application as well as suggestions for its
improvement.

<p><a name="index-supported-programming-languages-13"></a><a name="index-API_002c-C-14"></a><a name="index-API_002c-Fortran-15"></a><a name="index-API_002c-F90-16"></a><a name="index-API_002c-C_002b_002b-17"></a><a name="index-API_002c-Java-18"></a><a name="index-C-API-19"></a><a name="index-Fortran-API-20"></a><a name="index-F90-API-21"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-API-22"></a><a name="index-Java-API-23"></a>
The purpose of the Network Common Data Form (netCDF) interface is to
allow you to create, access, and share array-oriented data in a form
that is self-describing and portable. "Self-describing" means that a
dataset includes information defining the data it contains. "Portable"
means that the data in a dataset is represented in a form that can be
accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers,
characters, and floating-point numbers. Using the netCDF interface for
creating new datasets makes the data portable. Using the netCDF
interface in software for data access, management, analysis, and
display can make the software more generally useful.

   <p>The netCDF software includes C, Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and C++
interfaces for accessing netCDF data. These libraries are available
for many common computing platforms.

   <p>The community of netCDF users has contributed ports of the software to
additional platforms and interfaces for other programming languages as
well. Source code for netCDF software libraries is freely available to
encourage the sharing of both array-oriented data and the software
that makes the data useful.

   <p>This User's Guide presents the netCDF data model. It explains how the
netCDF data model uses dimensions, variables, and attributes to store
data. Language specific programming guides are available for C
(see <a href="netcdf-c.html#Top">The NetCDF C Interface Guide</a>), C++
(see <a href="netcdf-cxx.html#Top">The NetCDF C++ Interface Guide</a>), Fortran
77 (see <a href="netcdf-f77.html#Top">The NetCDF Fortran 77 Interface Guide</a>), and Fortran 90
(see <a href="netcdf-f90.html#Top">The NetCDF Fortran 90 Interface Guide</a>).

   <p>Reference documentation for UNIX systems, in the form of UNIX 'man'
pages for the C and FORTRAN interfaces is also available at the netCDF
web site (<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf</a>), and with the netCDF
distribution.

<h3 class="section">1.1 The NetCDF Interface</h3>

<p>The Network Common Data Form, or netCDF, is an interface to a library
of data access functions for storing and retrieving data in the form
of arrays. An array is an n-dimensional (where n is 0, 1, 2, ...) 
rectangular structure containing items which all have the same data
type (e.g., 8-bit character, 32-bit integer). A <dfn>scalar</dfn> (simple
single value) is a 0-dimensional array.

   <p>NetCDF is an abstraction that supports a view of data as a collection
of self-describing, portable objects that can be accessed through a
simple interface. Array values may be accessed directly, without
knowing details of how the data are stored. Auxiliary information
about the data, such as what units are used, may be stored with the
data. Generic utilities and application programs can access netCDF
datasets and transform, combine, analyze, or display specified fields
of the data. The development of such applications has led to improved
accessibility of data and improved re-usability of software for
array-oriented data management, analysis, and display.

   <p>The netCDF software implements an abstract data type, which means that
all operations to access and manipulate data in a netCDF dataset must
use only the set of functions provided by the interface. The
representation of the data is hidden from applications that use the
interface, so that how the data are stored could be changed without
affecting existing programs. The physical representation of netCDF
data is designed to be independent of the computer on which the data
were written.

   <p>Unidata supports the netCDF interfaces for C, (see <a href="netcdf-c.html#Top">The NetCDF C Interface Guide</a>), FORTRAN 77 (see <a href="netcdf-f77.html#Top">The NetCDF Fortran 77 Interface Guide</a>), FORTRAN 90 (see <a href="netcdf-f90.html#Top">The NetCDF Fortran 90 Interface Guide</a>), and C++ (see <a href="netcdf-cxx.html#Top">The NetCDF C++ Interface Guide</a>).

   <p>The netCDF library is supported for various UNIX operating systems. A
MS Windows port is also available. The software is also ported and
tested on a few other operating systems, with assistance from users
with access to these systems, before each major release. Unidata's
netCDF software is freely available via FTP to encourage its
widespread use. (<a href="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf">ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf</a>).

   <p>For detailed installation instructions, see the Porting and
Installation Guide. See <a href="netcdf-install.html#Top">The NetCDF Installation and Porting Guide</a>.

<h3 class="section">1.2 NetCDF Is Not a Database Management System</h3>

<p><a name="index-data-base-24"></a><a name="index-DBMS-25"></a>
Why not use an existing database management system for storing
array-oriented data? Relational database software is not suitable for
the kinds of data access supported by the netCDF interface.

   <p>First, existing database systems that support the relational model do
not support multidimensional objects (arrays) as a basic unit of data
access. Representing arrays as relations makes some useful kinds of
data access awkward and provides little support for the abstractions
of multidimensional data and coordinate systems. A quite different
data model is needed for array-oriented data to facilitate its
retrieval, modification, mathematical manipulation and visualization.

   <p>Related to this is a second problem with general-purpose database
systems: their poor performance on large arrays. Collections of
satellite images, scientific model outputs and long-term global
weather observations are beyond the capabilities of most database
systems to organize and index for efficient retrieval.

   <p>Finally, general-purpose database systems provide, at significant cost
in terms of both resources and access performance, many facilities
that are not needed in the analysis, management, and display of
array-oriented data. For example, elaborate update facilities, audit
trails, report formatting, and mechanisms designed for
transaction-processing are unnecessary for most scientific
applications.

<h3 class="section">1.3 The netCDF File Format</h3>

<p><a name="index-XDR-format-26"></a>
Until version 3.6.0, all versions of netCDF employed only one binary
data format, now referred to as netCDF classic format. NetCDF classic
is the default format for all versions of netCDF.

   <p>In version 3.6.0 a new binary format was introduced, 64-bit offset
format. Nearly identical to netCDF classic format, it uses 64-bit
offsets (hence the name), and allows users to create far larger
datasets.

   <p>By default, netCDF uses the classic format. To use the 64-bit offset
set the appropriate mode flag when creating the file.

   <p>To achieve network-transparency (machine-independence), netCDF classic
and 64-bit offset formats are implemented in terms of an external
representation much like XDR (eXternal Data Representation, see
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1832.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1832.txt</a>), a standard for describing
and encoding data. This representation provides encoding of data into
machine-independent sequences of bits. It has been implemented on a
wide variety of computers, by assuming only that eight-bit bytes can
be encoded and decoded in a consistent way. The IEEE 754
floating-point standard is used for floating-point data
representation.

   <p>Descriptions of the overall structure of netCDF classic and 64-bit
offset files are provided later in this manual. See <a href="#File-Structure-and-Performance">File Structure and Performance</a>.

   <p>The details of the classic and 64-bit offset formats are described in
an appendix.  See <a href="#File-Format-Specification">File Format Specification</a>. However, users are
discouraged from using the format specification to develop independent
low-level software for reading and writing netCDF files, because this
could lead to compatibility problems if the format is ever modified.

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.4 How to Select the Format</h3>

<p><a name="index-format-selection-advice-27"></a>
The format of a netCDF file is determined at create time. The default
is classic format. The 64-bit offset format will only be used if the
mode parameter to the create function includes the flag for 64-bit
offset format.

   <p>When opening an existing netCDF file the netCDF library will
transparently detect its format and adjust accordingly. However,
netCDF library versions earlier than 3.6.0 cannot read 64-bit offset
format files. NetCDF classic format files (even if created by version
3.6.0 or later) remain compatible with older versions of the netCDF
library.

   <p>Users are encouraged to use netCDF classic format to distribute data,
for maximum portability.

   <p>To select 64-bit offset format files, C programmers should use flag
NC_64BIT_OFFSET in function nc_create. See <a href="netcdf-c.html#nc_005fcreate">nc_create</a>.

   <p>In Fortran 77, use flag nf_64bit_offset in function

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.1 NetCDF Classic Format</h4>

<p>The original netCDF format is identified using four bytes in the file
header. All files in this format have &ldquo;CDF\001&rdquo; at the beginning of the
file. In this documentation this format is referred to as &ldquo;netCDF
classic format.&rdquo;

   <p>NetCDF classic format is identical to the format used by every
previous version of netCDF. It has maximum portability, and is still
the default netCDF format.

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.2 NetCDF 64-bit Offset Format</h4>

<p>Files with the 64-bit offsets are identified with a &ldquo;CDF\002&rdquo; at the
beginning of the file. In this documentation this format is called
&ldquo;64-bit offset format.&rdquo;

   <p>For some users, the various 2 GiB format limitations of the classic
format become a problem. (see <a href="#NetCDF-Classic-Format-Limitations">NetCDF Classic Format Limitations</a>). For these users, 64-bit offset format is a natural
choice. It greatly eases the size restrictions of netCDF classic files.

   <p>Since 64-bit offset format was introduced in version 3.6.0, earlier
versions of the netCDF library can't read 64-bit offset files.

   <p>Create files in 64-bit offset-4 format by specifying the 64 bit offset
flag when creating a file.

<h3 class="section">1.5 What about Performance?</h3>

<p><a name="index-performance_002c-introduction-28"></a>
One of the goals of netCDF is to support efficient access to small
subsets of large datasets. To support this goal, netCDF uses direct
access rather than sequential access. This can be much more efficient
when the order in which data is read is different from the order in
which it was written, or when it must be read in different orders for
different applications.

   <p>The amount of overhead for a portable external representation depends
on many factors, including the data type, the type of computer, the
granularity of data access, and how well the implementation has been
tuned to the computer on which it is run. This overhead is typically
small in comparison to the overall resources used by an
application. In any case, the overhead of the external representation
layer is usually a reasonable price to pay for portable data access.

   <p>Although efficiency of data access has been an important concern in
designing and implementing netCDF, it is still possible to use the
netCDF interface to access data in inefficient ways: for example, by
requesting a slice of data that requires a single value from each
record. Advice on how to use the interface efficiently is provided in
<a href="#File-Structure-and-Performance">File Structure and Performance</a>.

<h3 class="section">1.6 Is NetCDF a Good Archive Format?</h3>

<p><a name="index-archive-format-29"></a><a name="index-compression-30"></a>
NetCDF can be used as a general-purpose archive format for storing
arrays. Compression of data is possible with netCDF (e.g., using
arrays of eight-bit or 16-bit integers to encode low-resolution
floating-point numbers instead of arrays of 32-bit numbers), but the
current version of netCDF was not designed to achieve optimal
compression of data. Hence, using netCDF may require more space than
special-purpose archive formats that exploit knowledge of particular
characteristics of specific datasets.

<p><a name="index-applications_002c-generic_002c-conventions-31"></a><a name="index-conventions_002c-introduction-32"></a>
The mere use of netCDF is not sufficient to make data
"self-describing" and meaningful to both humans and machines. The
names of variables and dimensions should be meaningful and conform to
any relevant conventions. Dimensions should have corresponding
coordinate variables where sensible.

   <p>Attributes play a vital role in providing ancillary information. It is
important to use all the relevant standard attributes using the
relevant conventions. For a description of reserved attributes (used by
the netCDF library) and attribute conventions for generic application
software, see <a href="#Attribute-Conventions">Attribute Conventions</a>.

   <p>A number of groups have defined their own additional conventions and
styles for netCDF data. Descriptions of these conventions, as well as
examples incorporating them can be accessed from the netCDF
Conventions site, <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdfconventions.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdfconventions.html</a>.

   <p>These conventions should be used where suitable. Additional
conventions are often needed for local use. These should be
contributed to the above netCDF conventions site if likely to interest
other users in similar areas.

The development of the netCDF interface began with a modest goal
related to Unidata's needs: to provide a common interface between
Unidata applications and real-time meteorological data. Since Unidata
software was intended to run on multiple hardware platforms with
access from both C and FORTRAN, achieving Unidata's goals had the
potential for providing a package that was useful in a broader
context. By making the package widely available and collaborating with
other organizations with similar needs, we hoped to improve the then
current situation in which software for scientific data access was
only rarely reused by others in the same discipline and almost never
reused between disciplines (Fulker, 1988).

   <p>Important concepts employed in the netCDF software originated in a
paper (Treinish and Gough, 1987) that described data-access software
developed at the NASA Goddard National Space Science Data Center
(NSSDC). The interface provided by this software was called the Common
Data Format (CDF). The NASA CDF was originally developed as a
platform-specific FORTRAN library to support an abstraction for
storing arrays.

   <p>The NASA CDF package had been used for many different kinds of data in
an extensive collection of applications. It had the virtues of
simplicity (only 13 subroutines), independence from storage format,
generality, ability to support logical user views of data, and support
for generic applications.

   <p>Unidata held a workshop on CDF in Boulder in August 1987. We proposed
exploring the possibility of collaborating with NASA to extend the CDF
FORTRAN interface, to define a C interface, and to permit the access
of data aggregates with a single call, while maintaining compatibility
with the existing NASA interface.

   <p>Independently, Dave Raymond at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology had developed a package of C software for UNIX that
supported sequential access to self-describing array-oriented data and
a "pipes and filters" (or "data flow") approach to processing,
analyzing, and displaying the data. This package also used the "Common
Data Format" name, later changed to C-Based Analysis and Display
System (CANDIS). Unidata learned of Raymond's work (Raymond, 1988),
and incorporated some of his ideas, such as the use of named
dimensions and variables with differing shapes in a single data
object, into the Unidata netCDF interface.

   <p>In early 1988, Glenn Davis of Unidata developed a prototype netCDF
package in C that was layered on XDR. This prototype proved that a
single-file, XDR-based implementation of the CDF interface could be
achieved at acceptable cost and that the resulting programs could be
implemented on both UNIX and VMS systems. However, it also
demonstrated that providing a small, portable, and NASA CDF-compatible
FORTRAN interface with the desired generality was not
practical. NASA's CDF and Unidata's netCDF have since evolved
separately, but recent CDF versions share many characteristics with
netCDF.

   <p>In early 1988, Joe Fahle of SeaSpace, Inc. (a commercial software
development firm in San Diego, California), a participant in the 1987
Unidata CDF workshop, independently developed a CDF package in C that
extended the NASA CDF interface in several important ways (Fahle,
1989). Like Raymond's package, the SeaSpace CDF software permitted
variables with unrelated shapes to be included in the same data object
and permitted a general form of access to multidimensional
arrays. Fahle's implementation was used at SeaSpace as the
intermediate form of storage for a variety of steps in their
image-processing system. This interface and format have subsequently
evolved into the Terascan data format.

   <p>After studying Fahle's interface, we concluded that it solved many of
the problems we had identified in trying to stretch the NASA interface
to our purposes. In August 1988, we convened a small workshop to agree
on a Unidata netCDF interface, and to resolve remaining open
issues. Attending were Joe Fahle of SeaSpace, Michael Gough of Apple
(an author of the NASA CDF software), Angel Li of the University of
Miami (who had implemented our prototype netCDF software on VMS and
was a potential user), and Unidata systems development
staff. Consensus was reached at the workshop after some further
simplifications were discovered. A document incorporating the results
of the workshop into a proposed Unidata netCDF interface specification
was distributed widely for comments before Glenn Davis and Russ Rew
implemented the first version of the software. Comparison with other
data-access interfaces and experience using netCDF are discussed in
Rew and Davis (1990a), Rew and Davis (1990b), Jenter and Signell
(1992), and Brown, Folk, Goucher, and Rew (1993).

   <p>In October 1991, we announced version 2.0 of the netCDF software
distribution. Slight modifications to the C interface (declaring
dimension lengths to be long rather than int) improved the usability
of netCDF on inexpensive platforms such as MS-DOS computers, without
requiring recompilation on other platforms. This change to the
interface required no changes to the associated file format.

   <p>Release of netCDF version 2.3 in June 1993 preserved the same file
format but added single call access to records, optimizations for
accessing cross-sections involving non-contiguous data, subsampling
along specified dimensions (using 'strides'), accessing non-contiguous
data (using 'mapped array sections'), improvements to the ncdump and
ncgen utilities, and an experimental C++ interface.

   <p>In version 2.4, released in February 1996, support was added for new
platforms and for the C++ interface, significant optimizations
were implemented for supercomputer architectures, and the file format
was formally specified in an appendix to the User's Guide.

   <p>FAN (File Array Notation), software providing a high-level interface
to netCDF data, was made available in May 1996. The capabilities of
the FAN utilities include extracting and manipulating array data from
netCDF datasets, printing selected data from netCDF arrays, copying
ASCII data into netCDF arrays, and performing various operations (sum,
mean, max, min, product, and others) on netCDF arrays.

   <p>In 1996 and 1997, Joe Sirott implemented and made available the first
implementation of a read-only netCDF interface for Java, Bill Noon
made a Python module available for netCDF, and Konrad Hinsen
contributed another netCDF interface for Python.

   <p>In May 1997, Version 3.3 of netCDF was released. This included a new
type-safe interface for C and Fortran, as well as many other
improvements.  A month later, Charlie Zender released version 1.0 of
the NCO (netCDF Operators) package, providing command-line utilities
for general purpose operations on netCDF data.

   <p>Version 3.4 of Unidata's netCDF software, released in March 1998,
included initial large file support, performance enhancements, and
improved Cray platform support.  Later in 1998, Dan Schmitt provided a
Tcl/Tk interface, and Glenn Davis provided version 1.0 of netCDF for
Java.

   <p>In May 1999, Glenn Davis, who was instrumental in creating and
developing netCDF, died in a small plane crash during a
thunderstorm. The memory of Glenn's passions and intellect continue to
inspire those of us who worked with him.

   <p>In February 2000, an experimental Fortran 90 interface developed by
Robert Pincus was released.

   <p>John Caron released netCDF for Java, version 2.0 in February 2001. 
This version incorporated a new high-performance package for
multidimensional arrays, simplified the interface, and included
OPeNDAP (known previously as DODS) remote access, as well as remote
netCDF access via HTTP contributed by Don Denbo.

   <p>In March 2001, NetCDF 3.5.0 was released. This release fully
integrated the new Fortran 90 interface, enhanced portability,
improved the C++ interface, and added a few new tuning functions.

   <p>Also in 2001, Takeshi Horinouchi and colleagues made a netCDF
interface for Ruby available, as did David Pierce for the R language
for statistical computing and graphics.  Charles Denham released
WetCDF, an independent implementation of the netCDF interface for
MATLAB, as well as updates to the popular netCDF Toolbox for MATLAB.

   <p>In 2002, Unidata and collaborators developed NcML, an XML
representation for netCDF data useful for cataloging data holdings,
aggregation of data from multiple datasets, augmenting metadata in
existing datasets, and support for alternative views of data.  The
Java interface currently provides access to netCDF data through NcML.

   <p>Additional developments in 2002 included translation of C and Fortran
User Guides into Japanese by Masato Shiotani and colleagues, creation
of a &ldquo;Best Practices&rdquo; guide for writing netCDF files, and provision
of an Ada-95 interface by Alexandru Corlan.

   <p>In July 2003 a group of researchers at Northwestern University and
Argonne National Laboratory (Jianwei Li, Wei-keng Liao, Alok
Choudhary, Robert Ross, Rajeev Thakur, William Gropp, and Rob Latham)
contributed a new parallel interface for writing and reading netCDF
data, tailored for use on high performance platforms with parallel
I/O. The implementation built on the MPI-IO interface, providing
portability to many platforms.

   <p>In October 2003, Greg Sjaardema contributed support for an alternative
format with 64-bit offsets, to provide more complete support for very
large files. These changes, with slight modifications at Unidata, were
incorporated into version 3.6.0, released in December, 2004.

   <p>In 2004, thanks to a NASA grant, Unidata and NCSA began a
collaboration to increase the interoperability of netCDF and HDF5, and
bring some advanced HDF5 features to netCDF users. This resulted in
netCDF-4.0, currently (as of March, 2006) in alpha release.

<h3 class="section">1.10 Limitations of NetCDF</h3>

<p><a name="index-arrays_002c-ragged-59"></a><a name="index-writers_002c-multiple-60"></a><a name="index-limitations-of-netCDF-61"></a><a name="index-classic-netCDF-format-62"></a><a name="index-GiBytes-63"></a><a name="index-GBytes-64"></a>
The netCDF data model is widely applicable to data that can be
organized into a collection of named array variables with named
attributes, but there are some important limitations to the model and
its implementation in software.

   <p>Currently, netCDF offers a limited number of external numeric data
types: 8-, 16-, 32-bit integers, or 32- or 64-bit floating-point
numbers. This limited set of sizes may use file space inefficiently
compared to packing data in bit fields. For example, arrays of 9-bit
values must be stored in 16-bit short integers. Storing arrays of 1-
or 2-bit values in 8-bit values is even less optimal.

   <p>With the classic netCDF file format, there are constraints that limit
how a dataset is structured to store more than 2 <dfn>GiBytes</dfn> (2^30
or 1,073,741,824 bytes, as compared to a <dfn>Gbyte</dfn>, which is
1,000,000,000 bytes) of data in a single netCDF
dataset. (see <a href="#NetCDF-Classic-Format-Limitations">NetCDF Classic Format Limitations</a>).  This limitation
is a result of 32-bit offsets used for storing relative offsets within
a classic netCDF format file. Since one of the goals of netCDF is
portable data and some computing platforms still can't deal with files
larger than 2 GiB, it is best to keep files that must be portable
below this limit. Nevertheless, it is possible to create and access
netCDF files larger than 2 GiB on platforms that provide support for
such files (see <a href="#Large-File-Support">Large File Support</a>).

   <p>The new 64-bit offset format (introduced version 3.6.0) allows large
files, and makes it easy to create to create fixed variables of about
4 GiB, and record variables of about 4 GiB per record. (see <a href="#NetCDF-64-bit-Offset-Format-Limitations">NetCDF 64 bit Offset Format Limitations</a>). However, old netCDF applications
will not be able to read the 64-bit offset files until they are
upgraded to at least version 3.6.0 of netCDF.

   <p>Another limitation of the classic (and 64-bit offset) model is that
only one unlimited (changeable) dimension is permitted for each netCDF
data set. Multiple variables can share an unlimited dimension, but
then they must all grow together. Hence the netCDF model does not
permit variables with several unlimited dimensions or the use of
multiple unlimited dimensions in different variables within the same
dataset. Variables that have non-rectangular shapes (for example,
ragged arrays) cannot be represented conveniently.

   <p>The extent to which data can be completely self-describing is limited:
there is always some assumed context without which sharing and
archiving data would be impractical. NetCDF permits storing meaningful
names for variables, dimensions, and attributes; units of measure in a
form that can be used in computations; text strings for attribute
values that apply to an entire data set; and simple kinds of
coordinate system information. But for more complex kinds of metadata
(for example, the information necessary to provide accurate
georeferencing of data on unusual grids or from satellite images), it
is often necessary to develop conventions.

   <p>Specific additions to the netCDF data model might make some of these
conventions unnecessary or allow some forms of metadata to be
represented in a uniform and compact way. For example, adding explicit
georeferencing to the netCDF data model would simplify elaborate
georeferencing conventions at the cost of complicating the model. The
problem is finding an appropriate trade-off between the richness of
the model and its generality (i.e., its ability to encompass many
kinds of data). A data model tailored to capture the shared context
among researchers within one discipline may not be appropriate for
sharing or combining data from multiple disciplines.

   <p>The classic netCDF data model does not support nested data structures
such as trees, nested arrays, or other recursive structures. (This
limitation also applies to 64-bit offset files.) Through use of
indirection and conventions it is possible to represent some kinds of
nested structures, but the result may fall short of the netCDF goal of
self-describing data.

   <p>Finally, concurrent access to a netCDF dataset is limited. One writer
and multiple readers may access data in a single dataset
simultaneously, but there is no support for multiple concurrent
writers.

NetCDF-4.0 is currently available in alpha release. It allows the use
of HDF5 files from the netCDF API. New features available with
netCDF-4/HDF5 files include:

     <ul>
<li>The user of groups to organize datasets.

     <li>New unsigned integer data types, 64-bit integer types, and a string
type.

     <li>A user defined compound type, which can be constructed by users to
match a C struct or other arbitrary organization of types.

     <li>A variable length array type.

     <li>Support for parallel I/O.

   </ul>

   <p>NetCDF-4 also contains a complete upgrade of the installation and
build system, including the use of the libtool package to build shared
libraries on systems which support them.

<h3 class="section">2.1 The NetCDF Data Model</h3>

<p><a name="index-netCDF-data-model-69"></a><a name="index-data-model_002c-netCDF-70"></a><a name="index-naming-conventions-71"></a><a name="index-conventions_002c-naming-72"></a><a name="index-CDL_002c-example-73"></a><a name="index-common-data-form-language-74"></a><a name="index-ncdump_002c-introduction-75"></a>
A netCDF dataset contains dimensions, variables, and attributes, which
all have both a name and an ID number by which they are
identified. These components can be used together to capture the
meaning of data and relations among data fields in an array-oriented
dataset. The netCDF library allows simultaneous access to multiple
netCDF datasets which are identified by dataset ID numbers, in
addition to ordinary file names.

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 Naming Conventions</h4>

<p>The names of dimensions, variables and attributes consist of arbitrary
sequences of alphanumeric characters (as well as underscore '_',
period '.' and hyphen '-'), beginning with a letter or
underscore. (However names commencing with underscore are reserved for
system use.) Case is significant in netCDF names. A zero-length name
is not allowed.

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.2 Network Common Data Form Language (CDL)</h4>

<p>We will use a small netCDF example to illustrate the concepts of the
netCDF data model. This includes dimensions, variables, and
attributes. The notation used to describe this simple netCDF object is
called CDL (network Common Data form Language), which provides a
convenient way of describing netCDF datasets. The netCDF system
includes utilities for producing human-oriented CDL text files from
binary netCDF datasets and vice versa.

<pre class="example">     netcdf example_1 {  // example of CDL notation for a netCDF dataset
     
     dimensions:         // dimension names and lengths are declared first
             lat = 5, lon = 10, level = 4, time = unlimited;
     
     variables:          // variable types, names, shapes, attributes
             float   temp(time,level,lat,lon);
                         temp:long_name     = "temperature";
                         temp:units         = "celsius";
             float   rh(time,lat,lon);
                         rh:long_name = "relative humidity";
                         rh:valid_range = 0.0, 1.0;      // min and max
             int     lat(lat), lon(lon), level(level);
                         lat:units       = "degrees_north";
                         lon:units       = "degrees_east";
                         level:units     = "millibars";
             short   time(time);
                         time:units      = "hours since 1996-1-1";
             // global attributes
                         :source = "Fictional Model Output";
     
     data:                // optional data assignments
             level   = 1000, 850, 700, 500;
             lat     = 20, 30, 40, 50, 60;
             lon     = -160,-140,-118,-96,-84,-52,-45,-35,-25,-15;
             time    = 12;
             rh      =.5,.2,.4,.2,.3,.2,.4,.5,.6,.7,
                      .1,.3,.1,.1,.1,.1,.5,.7,.8,.8,

     }
</pre>
   <p>The CDL notation for a netCDF dataset can be generated automatically
by using ncdump, a utility program described later
(see <a href="#ncdump">ncdump</a>). Another netCDF utility, ncgen, generates a netCDF
dataset (or optionally C or FORTRAN source code containing calls
needed to produce a netCDF dataset) from CDL input (see <a href="#ncgen">ncgen</a>).

   <p>The CDL notation is simple and largely self-explanatory. It will be
explained more fully as we describe the components of a netCDF
dataset. For now, note that CDL statements are terminated by a
semicolon. Spaces, tabs, and newlines can be used freely for
readability. Comments in CDL follow the characters '//' on any line. A
CDL description of a netCDF dataset takes the form

<pre class="example">       netCDF name {
         dimensions: ...
         variables: ...
         data: ...
       }
</pre>
   <p>where the name is used only as a default in constructing file names by
the ncgen utility. The CDL description consists of three optional
parts, introduced by the keywords dimensions, variables, and
data. NetCDF dimension declarations appear after the dimensions
keyword, netCDF variables and attributes are defined after the
variables keyword, and variable data assignments appear after the data
keyword.

   <p>The ncgen utility provides a command line option which indicates the
desired output format. Limitations are enforced for the selected
format - that is, some cdl files may be expressible only in 64-bit
offset format.

   <p>For example, trying to create a file with very large variables in
classic format may result in an error because size limits are
violated.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Dimensions</h3>

<p><a name="index-appending-data-along-unlimited-dimension-76"></a><a name="index-dimensions_002c-introduction-77"></a><a name="index-dimensions_002c-unlimited-78"></a><a name="index-unlimited-dimensions-79"></a><a name="index-multiple-unlimited-dimensions-80"></a>
A dimension may be used to represent a real physical dimension, for
example, time, latitude, longitude, or height. A dimension might also
be used to index other quantities, for example station or
model-run-number.

   <p>A netCDF dimension has both a name and a length.

   <p>A dimension length is an arbitrary positive integer, except that one
dimension can have the length UNLIMITED.

   <p>Such a dimension is called the unlimited dimension or the record
dimension. A variable with an unlimited dimension can grow to any
length along that dimension. The unlimited dimension index is like a
record number in conventional record-oriented files.

   <p>A netCDF classic or 64-bit offset dataset can have at most one
unlimited dimension, but need not have any. If a variable has an
unlimited dimension, that dimension must be the most significant
(slowest changing) one. Thus any unlimited dimension must be the first
dimension in a CDL shape and the first dimension in corresponding C
array declarations.

   <p>To grow variables along an unlimited dimension, write the data using
any of the netCDF data writing functions, and specify the index of the
unlimited dimension to the desired record number. The netCDF library
will write however many records are needed (using the fill value,
unless turned off) to fill in any intervening records.

   <p>CDL dimension declarations may appear on one or more lines following
the CDL keyword dimensions. Multiple dimension declarations on the
same line may be separated by commas. Each declaration is of the form
name = length.

   <p>There are four dimensions in the above example: lat, lon, level, and
time (see <a href="#The-NetCDF-Data-Model">The NetCDF Data Model</a>). The first three are assigned
fixed lengths; time is assigned the length UNLIMITED, which means it
is the unlimited dimension.

   <p>The basic unit of named data in a netCDF dataset is a variable. When a
variable is defined, its shape is specified as a list of
dimensions. These dimensions must already exist. The number of
dimensions is called the rank (a.k.a. dimensionality). A scalar
variable has rank 0, a vector has rank 1 and a matrix has rank 2.

   <p>It is possible (since version 3.1 of netCDF) to use the same dimension
more than once in specifying a variable shape. For example,
correlation(instrument, instrument) could be a matrix giving
correlations between measurements using different instruments. But
data whose dimensions correspond to those of physical space/time
should have a shape comprising different dimensions, even if some of
these have the same length.

Variables are used to store the bulk of the data in a netCDF
dataset. A variable represents an array of values of the same type. A
scalar value is treated as a 0-dimensional array. A variable has a
name, a data type, and a shape described by its list of dimensions
specified when the variable is created. A variable may also have
associated attributes, which may be added, deleted or changed after
the variable is created.

   <p>A variable external data type is one of a small set of netCDF
types. In classic and 64-bit offset files, only the original six types
are available (byte, character, short, int, float, and
double).

   <p>For more information on types for the C interface, See <a href="netcdf-c.html#Variable-Types">Variable Types</a>.

   <p>For more information on types for the Fortran interface,
See <a href="netcdf-f77.html#Variable-Types">Variable Types</a>.

   <p>In the CDL notation, only classic and 64-bit offset type can be
used. They are given the simpler names byte, char, short, int, float,
and double. real may be used as a synonym for float in the CDL
notation. long is a deprecated synonym for int. For the exact meaning
of each of the types see <a href="#netCDF-external-data-types">netCDF external data types</a>.

   <p>CDL variable declarations appear after the variable keyword in a CDL
unit. They have the form

<pre class="example">          type variable_name ( dim_name_1, dim_name_2, ... );
</pre>
   <p>for variables with dimensions, or

<pre class="example">          type variable_name;
</pre>
   <p>for scalar variables.

   <p>In the above CDL example there are six variables. As discussed below,
four of these are coordinate variables. The remaining variables
(sometimes called primary variables), temp and rh, contain what is
usually thought of as the data. Each of these variables has the
unlimited dimension time as its first dimension, so they are called
record variables. A variable that is not a record variable has a fixed
length (number of data values) given by the product of its dimension
lengths. The length of a record variable is also the product of its
dimension lengths, but in this case the product is variable because it
involves the length of the unlimited dimension, which can vary. The
length of the unlimited dimension is the number of records.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.1 Coordinate Variables</h4>

<p>It is legal for a variable to have the same name as a dimension. Such
variables have no special meaning to the netCDF library. However there
is a convention that such variables should be treated in a special way
by software using this library.

   <p>A variable with the same name as a dimension is called a coordinate
variable. It typically defines a physical coordinate corresponding to
that dimension. The above CDL example includes the coordinate
variables lat, lon, level and time, defined as follows:

<pre class="example">             int     lat(lat), lon(lon), level(level);
             short   time(time);
     ...
     data:
             level   = 1000, 850, 700, 500;
             lat     = 20, 30, 40, 50, 60;
             lon     = -160,-140,-118,-96,-84,-52,-45,-35,-25,-15;
             time    = 12;
</pre>
   <p>These define the latitudes, longitudes, barometric pressures and times
corresponding to positions along these dimensions. Thus there is data
at altitudes corresponding to 1000, 850, 700 and 500 millibars; and at
latitudes 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 degrees north. Note that each
coordinate variable is a vector and has a shape consisting of just the
dimension with the same name.

   <p>A position along a dimension can be specified using an index. This is
an integer with a minimum value of 0 for C programs, 1 in Fortran
programs. Thus the 700 millibar level would have an index value of 2
in the example above in a C program, and 3 in a Fortran program.

   <p>If a dimension has a corresponding coordinate variable, then this
provides an alternative, and often more convenient, means of
specifying position along it. Current application packages that make
use of coordinate variables commonly assume they are numeric vectors
and strictly monotonic (all values are different and either increasing
or decreasing).

<h3 class="section">2.4 Attributes</h3>

<p><a name="index-attributes_002c-defined-104"></a><a name="index-attributes_002c-defining-in-CDL-105"></a><a name="index-attributes_002c-adding-to-existing-dataset-106"></a><a name="index-CDL_002c-defining-attributes-107"></a><a name="index-CDL_002c-defining-global-attributes-108"></a><a name="index-ancillary-data_002c-storing-109"></a><a name="index-storing-ancillary-data-110"></a><a name="index-applications_002c-generic-111"></a><a name="index-generic-applications-112"></a><a name="index-attributes_002c-data-type-113"></a><a name="index-attributes_002c-global-114"></a><a name="index-attributes_002c-operations-on-115"></a><a name="index-global-attributes-116"></a><a name="index-operations-on-attributes-117"></a>
NetCDF attributes are used to store data about the data (ancillary
data or metadata), similar in many ways to the information stored in
data dictionaries and schema in conventional database systems. Most
attributes provide information about a specific variable. These are
identified by the name (or ID) of that variable, together with the
name of the attribute.

   <p>Some attributes provide information about the dataset as a whole and
are called global attributes. These are identified by the attribute
name together with a blank variable name (in CDL) or a special null
"global variable" ID (in C or Fortran).

   <p>An attribute has an associated variable (the null "global variable"
for a global or group-level attribute), a name, a data type, a length,
and a value. The current version treats all attributes as vectors;
scalar values are treated as single-element vectors.

   <p>Conventional attribute names should be used where applicable. New
names should be as meaningful as possible.

   <p>The external type of an attribute is specified when it is created. The
types permitted for attributes are the same as the netCDF external
data types for variables. Attributes with the same name for different
variables should sometimes be of different types. For example, the
attribute valid_max specifying the maximum valid data value for a
variable of type int should be of type int, whereas the attribute
valid_max for a variable of type double should instead be of type
double.

   <p>Attributes are more dynamic than variables or dimensions; they can be
deleted and have their type, length, and values changed after they are
created, whereas the netCDF interface provides no way to delete a
variable or to change its type or shape.

   <p>The CDL notation for defining an attribute is

<pre class="example">         variable_name:attribute_name = list_of_values;
</pre>
   <p>for a variable attribute, or

<pre class="example">         :attribute_name = list_of_values;
</pre>
   <p>for a global attribute.

   <p>The type and length of each attribute are not explicitly declared in
CDL; they are derived from the values assigned to the attribute. All
values of an attribute must be of the same type. The notation used for
constant values of the various netCDF types is discussed later
(see <a href="#CDL-Notation-for-Data-Constants">CDL Notation for Data Constants</a>).

   <p>In the netCDF example (see <a href="#The-NetCDF-Data-Model">The NetCDF Data Model</a>), units
is an attribute for the variable lat that has a 13-character array
value 'degrees_north'. And valid_range is an attribute for the
variable rh that has length 2 and values '0.0' and '1.0'.

   <p>One global attribute, called &ldquo;source&rdquo;, is defined for the example
netCDF dataset. This is a character array intended for documenting the
data. Actual netCDF datasets might have more global attributes to
document the origin, history, conventions, and other characteristics
of the dataset as a whole.

   <p>Most generic applications that process netCDF datasets assume standard
attribute conventions and it is strongly recommended that these be
followed unless there are good reasons for not doing so. For
information about units, long_name, valid_min, valid_max, valid_range,
scale_factor, add_offset, _FillValue, and other conventional
attributes, see <a href="#Attribute-Conventions">Attribute Conventions</a>.

   <p>Attributes may be added to a netCDF dataset long after it is first
defined, so you don't have to anticipate all potentially useful
attributes. However adding new attributes to an existing classic or
64-bit offset format dataset can incur the same expense as copying the
dataset. For a more extensive discussion see <a href="#File-Structure-and-Performance">File Structure and Performance</a>.

<h3 class="section">2.5 Differences between Attributes and Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-ancillary-data-as-attributes-118"></a><a name="index-attributes-vs_002e-variables-119"></a><a name="index-variables-vs_002e-attributes-120"></a><a name="index-differences-between-attributes-and-variables-121"></a>
In contrast to variables, which are intended for bulk data, attributes
are intended for ancillary data, or information about the data. The
total amount of ancillary data associated with a netCDF object, and
stored in its attributes, is typically small enough to be
memory-resident. However variables are often too large to entirely fit
in memory and must be split into sections for processing.

   <p>Another difference between attributes and variables is that variables
may be multidimensional. Attributes are all either scalars
(single-valued) or vectors (a single, fixed dimension).

   <p>Variables are created with a name, type, and shape before they are
assigned data values, so a variable may exist with no values.  The
value of an attribute is specified when it is created, unless it is a
zero-length attribute.

   <p>A variable may have attributes, but an attribute cannot have
attributes. Attributes assigned to variables may have the same units
as the variable (for example, valid_range) or have no units (for
example, scale_factor). If you want to store data that requires units
different from those of the associated variable, it is better to use a
variable than an attribute. More generally, if data require ancillary
data to describe them, are multidimensional, require any of the
defined netCDF dimensions to index their values, or require a
significant amount of storage, that data should be represented using
variables rather than attributes.

The atomic external types supported by the netCDF interface are:

   <p><table summary="">
<tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="15%">C name </td><td valign="top" width="15%">Fortran name </td><td valign="top" width="70%">storage

   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p>These types were chosen to provide a reasonably wide range of
trade-offs between data precision and number of bits required for each
value. These external data types are independent from whatever
internal data types are supported by a particular machine and language
combination.

   <p>These types are called "external", because they correspond to the
portable external representation for netCDF data. When a program reads
external netCDF data into an internal variable, the data is converted,
if necessary, into the specified internal type. Similarly, if you
write internal data into a netCDF variable, this may cause it to be
converted to a different external type, if the external type for the
netCDF variable differs from the internal type.

   <p>The separation of external and internal types and automatic type
conversion have several advantages. You need not be aware of the
external type of numeric variables, since automatic conversion to or
from any desired numeric type is available. You can use this feature
to simplify code, by making it independent of external types, using a
sufficiently wide internal type, e.g., double precision, for numeric
netCDF data of several different external types. Programs need not be
changed to accommodate a change to the external type of a variable.

   <p>If conversion to or from an external numeric type is necessary, it is
handled by the library.

   <p>Converting from one numeric type to another may result in an error if
the target type is not capable of representing the converted
value. For example, an internal short integer type may not be able to
hold data stored externally as an integer. When accessing an array of
values, a range error is returned if one or more values are out of the
range of representable values, but other values are converted
properly.

   <p>Note that mere loss of precision in type conversion does not return an
error. Thus, if you read double precision values into a
single-precision floating-point variable, for example, no error
results unless the magnitude of the double precision value exceeds the
representable range of single-precision floating point numbers on your
platform. Similarly, if you read a large integer into a float
incapable of representing all the bits of the integer in its mantissa,
this loss of precision will not result in an error. If you want to
avoid such precision loss, check the external types of the variables
you access to make sure you use an internal type that has adequate
precision.

   <p>The names for the primitive external data types (byte, char, short,
ushort, int, uint, int64, uint64, float or real, double, bool, string)
are reserved words in CDL, so the names of variables, dimensions, and
attributes must not be type names.

   <p>It is possible to interpret byte data as either signed (-128 to 127)
or unsigned (0 to 255). However, when reading byte data to be
converted into other numeric types, it is interpreted as signed.

types of a language see <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>.

<p><a name="index-data_002c-reading-127"></a><a name="index-data_002c-writing-128"></a><a name="index-access-random-129"></a>
To access (read or write) netCDF data you specify an open netCDF
dataset, a netCDF variable, and information (e.g., indices)
identifying elements of the variable. The name of the access function
corresponds to the internal type of the data. If the internal type has
a different representation from the external type of the variable, a
conversion between the internal type and external type will take place
when the data is read or written.

   <p>Access to data in classic and 64-bit offset format is direct. In
either case you can access a small subset of data from a large dataset
efficiently, without first accessing all the data that precedes it.

   <p>Reading and writing data by specifying a variable, instead of a
position in a file, makes data access independent of how many other
variables are in the dataset, making programs immune to data format
changes that involve adding more variables to the data.

   <p>In the C and FORTRAN interfaces, datasets are not specified by name
every time you want to access data, but instead by a small integer
called a dataset ID, obtained when the dataset is first created or
opened.

   <p>Similarly, a variable is not specified by name for every data access
either, but by a variable ID, a small integer used to identify each
variable in a netCDF dataset.

<h4 class="subsection">3.2.1 Forms of Data Access</h4>

<p><a name="index-array-section_002c-corner-130"></a><a name="index-array-section_002c-definition-131"></a><a name="index-array-section_002c-edges-132"></a><a name="index-array-section_002c-mapped-133"></a>
The netCDF interface supports several forms of direct access to data
values in an open netCDF dataset. We describe each of these forms of
access in order of increasing generality:

     <ul>
<li>access to all elements;

     <li>access to individual elements, specified with an index vector;

     <li>access to array sections, specified with an index vector, and count
vector;

     <li>access to sub-sampled array sections, specified with an index vector,
count vector, and stride vector; and

     <li>access to mapped array sections, specified with an index vector, count
vector, stride vector, and an index mapping vector.

   </ul>

   <p>The four types of vector (index vector, count vector, stride vector
and index mapping vector) each have one element for each dimension of
the variable. Thus, for an n-dimensional variable (rank = n),
n-element vectors are needed. If the variable is a scalar (no
dimensions), these vectors are ignored.

   <p>An array section is a "slab" or contiguous rectangular block that is
specified by two vectors. The index vector gives the indices of the
element in the corner closest to the origin. The count vector gives
the lengths of the edges of the slab along each of the variable's
dimensions, in order. The number of values accessed is the product of
these edge lengths.

   <p>A subsampled array section is similar to an array section, except that
an additional stride vector is used to specify sampling. This vector
has an element for each dimension giving the length of the strides to
be taken along that dimension. For example, a stride of 4 means every
fourth value along the corresponding dimension. The total number of
values accessed is again the product of the elements of the count
vector.

   <p>A mapped array section is similar to a subsampled array section except
that an additional index mapping vector allows one to specify how data
values associated with the netCDF variable are arranged in memory. The
offset of each value from the reference location, is given by the sum
of the products of each index (of the imaginary internal array which
would be used if there were no mapping) by the corresponding element
of the index mapping vector. The number of values accessed is the same
as for a subsampled array section.

   <p>The use of mapped array sections is discussed more fully below, but
first we present an example of the more commonly used array-section
access.

<h4 class="subsection">3.2.2 A C Example of Array-Section Access</h4>

<p><a name="index-access-C-example-of-array-section-134"></a><a name="index-array-section_002c-C-example-135"></a>
Assume that in our earlier example of a netCDF dataset
(see <a href="#The-NetCDF-Data-Model">Network Common Data Form Language (CDL)</a>), we wish to read a cross-section of all the data for
the temp variable at one level (say, the second), and assume that
there are currently three records (time values) in the netCDF
dataset. Recall that the dimensions are defined as

<pre class="example">       lat = 5, lon = 10, level = 4, time = unlimited;
</pre>
   <p>and the variable temp is declared as

<pre class="example">       float   temp(time, level, lat, lon);
</pre>
   <p>in the CDL notation.

   <p>A corresponding C variable that holds data for only one level might be
declared as

<pre class="example">     #define LATS  5
     #define LONS 10
     #define LEVELS 1
     #define TIMES 3                 /* currently */
         ...
     float   temp[TIMES*LEVELS*LATS*LONS];
     
     to keep the data in a one-dimensional array, or
     
         ...
     float   temp[TIMES][LEVELS][LATS][LONS];
</pre>
   <p>using a multidimensional array declaration.

   <p>To specify the block of data that represents just the second level,
all times, all latitudes, and all longitudes, we need to provide a
start index and some edge lengths. The start index should be (0, 1, 0,
0) in C, because we want to start at the beginning of each of the
time, lon, and lat dimensions, but we want to begin at the second
value of the level dimension. The edge lengths should be (3, 1, 5, 10)
in C, (since we want to get data for all three time values, only one
level value, all five lat values, and all 10 lon values. We should
expect to get a total of 150 floating-point values returned (3 * 1 * 5
* 10), and should provide enough space in our array for this many. The
order in which the data will be returned is with the last dimension,
lon, varying fastest:

<pre class="example">          temp[0][1][0][0]
          temp[0][1][0][1]
          temp[0][1][0][2]
          temp[0][1][0][3]
     
                ...
     
          temp[2][1][4][7]
          temp[2][1][4][8]
          temp[2][1][4][9]
</pre>
   <p>Different dimension orders for the C, FORTRAN, or other language
interfaces do not reflect a different order for values stored on the
disk, but merely different orders supported by the procedural
interfaces to the languages. In general, it does not matter whether a
netCDF dataset is written using the C, FORTRAN, or another language
interface; netCDF datasets written from any supported language may be
read by programs written in other supported languages.

<h4 class="subsection">3.2.3 More on General Array Section Access for C</h4>

<p>The use of mapped array sections allows non-trivial relationships
between the disk addresses of variable elements and the addresses
where they are stored in memory. For example, a matrix in memory could
be the transpose of that on disk, giving a quite different order of
elements. In a regular array section, the mapping between the disk and
memory addresses is trivial: the structure of the in-memory values
(i.e., the dimensional lengths and their order) is identical to that
of the array section. In a mapped array section, however, an index
mapping vector is used to define the mapping between indices of netCDF
variable elements and their memory addresses.

   <p>With mapped array access, the offset (number of array elements) from
the origin of a memory-resident array to a particular point is given
by the inner product[1] of the index mapping vector with the point's
coordinate offset vector. A point's coordinate offset vector gives,
for each dimension, the offset from the origin of the containing array
to the point.In C, a point's coordinate offset vector is the same as
its coordinate vector.

   <p>The index mapping vector for a regular array section would have&ndash;in
order from most rapidly varying dimension to most slowly&ndash;a constant
1, the product of that value with the edge length of the most rapidly
varying dimension of the array section, then the product of that value
with the edge length of the next most rapidly varying dimension, and
so on. In a mapped array, however, the correspondence between netCDF
variable disk locations and memory locations can be different.

   <p>For example, the following C definitions

<pre class="example">     struct vel {
         int flags;
         float u;
         float v;
     } vel[NX][NY];
     ptrdiff_t imap[2] = {
         sizeof(struct vel),
         sizeof(struct vel)*NY
     };
</pre>
   <p>where imap is the index mapping vector, can be used to access the
memory-resident values of the netCDF variable, vel(NY,NX), even though
the dimensions are transposed and the data is contained in a 2-D array
of structures rather than a 2-D array of floating-point values.

   <p>A detailed example of mapped array access is presented in the
description of the interfaces for mapped array
access. See <a href="netcdf-c.html#nc_005fput_005fvarm_005f-type">Write a Mapped Array of Values - nc_put_varm_ type</a>.

   <p>Note that, although the netCDF abstraction allows the use of
subsampled or mapped array-section access there use is not
required. If you do not need these more general forms of access, you
may ignore these capabilities and use single value access or regular
array section access instead.

   <p>In FORTRAN, the dimensions are reversed from the CDL declaration with
the first dimension varying fastest and the record dimension as the
last dimension of a record variable. Thus a FORTRAN declarations for a
variable that holds data for only one level is

          TEMP( 2, 1, 2, 1)
          TEMP( 3, 1, 2, 1)

to the point. In FORTRAN, the values of a point's coordinate offset
vector are one less than the corresponding values of the point's
coordinate vector, e.g., the array element A(3,5) has coordinate
offset vector [2, 4].

   <p>The index mapping vector for a regular array section would have&ndash;in

<h3 class="section">3.3 Type Conversion</h3>

<p><a name="index-type-conversion-138"></a><a name="index-byte-array-vs_002e-text-string-139"></a><a name="index-data-types_002c-conversion-140"></a>
Each netCDF variable has an external type, specified when the variable
is first defined. This external type determines whether the data is
intended for text or numeric values, and if numeric, the range and
precision of numeric values.

   <p>If the netCDF external type for a variable is char, only character
data representing text strings can be written to or read from the
variable. No automatic conversion of text data to a different
representation is supported.

   <p>If the type is numeric, however, the netCDF library allows you to
access the variable data as a different type and provides automatic
conversion between the numeric data in memory and the data in the
netCDF variable. For example, if you write a program that deals with
all numeric data as double-precision floating point values, you can
read netCDF data into double-precision arrays without knowing or
caring what the external type of the netCDF variables are. On reading
netCDF data, integers of various sizes and single-precision
floating-point values will all be converted to double-precision, if
you use the data access interface for double-precision values. Of
course, you can avoid automatic numeric conversion by using the netCDF
interface for a value type that corresponds to the external data type
of each netCDF variable, where such value types exist.

   <p>The automatic numeric conversions performed by netCDF are easy to
understand, because they behave just like assignment of data of one
type to a variable of a different type. For example, if you read
floating-point netCDF data as integers, the result is truncated
towards zero, just as it would be if you assigned a floating-point
value to an integer variable. Such truncation is an example of the
loss of precision that can occur in numeric conversions.

   <p>Converting from one numeric type to another may result in an error if
the target type is not capable of representing the converted
value. For example, an integer may not be able to hold data stored
externally as an IEEE floating-point number. When accessing an array
of values, a range error is returned if one or more values are out of
the range of representable values, but other values are converted
properly.

   <p>Note that mere loss of precision in type conversion does not result in
an error. For example, if you read double precision values into an
integer, no error results unless the magnitude of the double precision
value exceeds the representable range of integers on your
platform. Similarly, if you read a large integer into a float
incapable of representing all the bits of the integer in its mantissa,
this loss of precision will not result in an error. If you want to
avoid such precision loss, check the external types of the variables
you access to make sure you use an internal type that has a compatible
precision.

   <p>Whether a range error occurs in writing a large floating-point value
near the boundary of representable values may be depend on the
platform. The largest floating-point value you can write to a netCDF
float variable is the largest floating-point number representable on
your system that is less than 2 to the 128th power. The largest double
precision value you can write to a double variable is the largest
double-precision number representable on your system that is less than
2 to the 1024th power.

The only kind of data structure directly supported by the netCDF
classic (and 64-bit offset) abstraction is a collection of named
arrays with attached vector attributes. NetCDF is not particularly
well-suited for storing linked lists, trees, sparse matrices, ragged
arrays or other kinds of data structures requiring pointers.

   <p>It is possible to build other kinds of data structures in netCDF, from
sets of arrays by adopting various conventions regarding the use of
data in one array as pointers into another array. The netCDF library
won't provide much help or hindrance with constructing such data
structures, but netCDF provides the mechanisms with which such
conventions can be designed.

   <p>The following netCDF classic example stores a ragged array ragged_mat using an
attribute row_index to name an associated index variable giving the
index of the start of each row. In this example, the first row
contains 12 elements, the second row contains 7 elements (19 - 12),
and so on.

<pre class="example">             float   ragged_mat(max_elements);
                     ragged_mat:row_index = "row_start";
             int     row_start(max_rows);
     data:
             row_start   = 0, 12, 19, ...
</pre>
   <p>As another example, netCDF variables may be grouped within a netCDF
classic or 64-bit offset dataset by defining attributes that list the
names of the variables in each group, separated by a conventional
delimiter such as a space or comma. Using a naming convention for
attribute names for such groupings permits any number of named groups
of variables. A particular conventional attribute for each variable
might list the names of the groups of which it is a member. Use of
attributes, or variables that refer to other attributes or variables,
provides a flexible mechanism for representing some kinds of complex
structures in netCDF datasets.

This chapter describes the file structure of a netCDF classic or
64-bit offset dataset in enough detail to aid in understanding netCDF
performance issues.

   <p>NetCDF is a data abstraction for array-oriented data access and a
software library that provides a concrete implementation of the
interfaces that support that abstraction. The implementation provides
a machine-independent format for representing arrays. Although the
netCDF file format is hidden below the interfaces, some understanding
of the current implementation and associated file structure may help
to make clear why some netCDF operations are more expensive than
others.

   <p>For a detailed description of the netCDF format, see <a href="#File-Structure-and-Performance">File Structure and Performance</a>. Knowledge of the format is not needed for reading
and writing netCDF data or understanding most efficiency
issues. Programs that use only the documented interfaces and that make
no assumptions about the format will continue to work even if the
netCDF format is changed in the future, because any such change will
be made below the documented interfaces and will support earlier
versions of the netCDF file format.

     <li>a data part, comprising fixed-size data, containing the data for
variables that don't have an unlimited dimension; and variable-size
data, containing the data for variables that have an unlimited
dimension.
        </ol>

   <p>Both the header and data parts are represented in a
machine-independent form. This form is very similar to XDR (eXternal
Data Representation), extended to support efficient storage of arrays
of non-byte data.

   <p>The header at the beginning of the file contains information about the
dimensions, variables, and attributes in the file, including their
names, types, and other characteristics. The information about each
variable includes the offset to the beginning of the variable's data
for fixed-size variables or the relative offset of other variables
within a record. The header also contains dimension lengths and
information needed to map multidimensional indices for each variable
to the appropriate offsets.

   <p>By default, this header has little usable extra space; it is only as
large as it needs to be for the dimensions, variables, and attributes
(including all the attribute values) in the netCDF dataset, with a
small amount of extra space from rounding up to the nearest disk block
size. This has the advantage that netCDF files are compact, requiring
very little overhead to store the ancillary data that makes the
datasets self-describing. A disadvantage of this organization is that
any operation on a netCDF dataset that requires the header to grow
(or, less likely, to shrink), for example adding new dimensions or new
variables, requires moving the data by copying it. This expense is
incurred when the enddef function is called: nc_enddef in C
(see <a href="netcdf-c.html#nc_005fenddef">nc_enddef</a>), NF_ENDDEF in Fortran
(see <a href="netcdf-f77.html#NF_005fENDDEF">NF_ENDDEF</a>), after a previous
call to the redef function: nc_redef in C (see <a href="netcdf-c.html#nc_005fredef">nc_redef</a>) or NF_REDEF in Fortran (see <a href="netcdf-f77.html#NF_005fREDEF">NF_REDEF</a>). If you create all necessary dimensions,
variables, and attributes before writing data, and avoid later
additions and renamings of netCDF components that require more space
in the header part of the file, you avoid the cost associated with
later changing the header.

   <p>Alternatively, you can use an alternative version of the enddef
function with two underbar characters instead of one to explicitly
reserve extra space in the file header when the file is created: in C
nc__enddef (see <a href="netcdf-c.html#nc_005f_005fenddef">nc__enddef</a>), in Fortran
NF__ENDDEF (see <a href="netcdf-f77.html#NF_005f_005fENDDEF">NF__ENDDEF</a>), after
a previous call to the redef function.  This avoids the expense of
moving all the data later by reserving enough extra space in the
header to accommodate anticipated changes, such as the addition of new
attributes or the extension of existing string attributes to hold
longer strings.

   <p>When the size of the header is changed, data in the file is moved, and
the location of data values in the file changes. If another program is
reading the netCDF dataset during redefinition, its view of the file
will be based on old, probably incorrect indexes. If netCDF datasets
are shared across redefinition, some mechanism external to the netCDF
library must be provided that prevents access by readers during
redefinition, and causes the readers to call nc_sync/NF_SYNC before
any subsequent access.

   <p>The fixed-size data part that follows the header contains all the
variable data for variables that do not employ an unlimited
dimension. The data for each variable is stored contiguously in this
part of the file. If there is no unlimited dimension, this is the last
part of the netCDF file.

   <p>The record-data part that follows the fixed-size data consists of a
variable number of fixed-size records, each of which contains data for
all the record variables. The record data for each variable is stored
contiguously in each record.

   <p>The order in which the variable data appears in each data section is
the same as the order in which the variables were defined, in
increasing numerical order by netCDF variable ID. This knowledge can
sometimes be used to enhance data access performance, since the best
data access is currently achieved by reading or writing the data in
sequential order.

<h3 class="section">4.2 The Extended XDR Layer</h3>

<p><a name="index-XDR-layer-149"></a>
XDR is a standard for describing and encoding data and a library of
functions for external data representation, allowing programmers to
encode data structures in a machine-independent way. Classic or 64-bit
offset NetCDF employs an extended form of XDR for representing
information in the header part and the data parts. This extended XDR
is used to write portable data that can be read on any other machine
for which the library has been implemented.

   <p>The cost of using a canonical external representation for data varies
according to the type of data and whether the external form is the
same as the machine's native form for that type.

   <p>For some data types on some machines, the time required to convert
data to and from external form can be significant. The worst case is
reading or writing large arrays of floating-point data on a machine
that does not use IEEE floating-point as its native representation.

It is possible to write netCDF files that exceed 2 GiByte on platforms
that have "Large File Support" (LFS). Such files are
platform-independent to other LFS platforms, but trying to open them
on an older platform without LFS yields a "file too large" error.

   <p>Without LFS, no files larger than 2 GiBytes can be used. The rest of
this section applies only to systems with LFS.

   <p>The original binary format of netCDF (classic format) limits the size
of data files by using a signed 32-bit offset within its internal
structure. Files larger than 2 GiB can be created, with certain
limitations. See <a href="#NetCDF-Classic-Format-Limitations">NetCDF Classic Format Limitations</a>.

   <p>In version 3.6.0, netCDF included its first-ever variant of the underlying
data format.  The new format introduced in 3.6.0 uses 64-bit file offsets
in place of the 32-bit offsets. There are still some limits on the sizes
of variables, but the new format can create very large
datasets. See <a href="#NetCDF-64-bit-Offset-Format-Limitations">NetCDF 64 bit Offset Format Limitations</a>.

   <p>The original data format (netCDF classic), is still the default data
format for the netCDF library.

   <p>The following table summarizes the size limitations of various
permutations of LFS support, netCDF version, and data format. Note
that 1 GiB = 2^30 bytes or about 1.07e+9 bytes, 1 EiB = 2^60 bytes or
about 1.15e+18 bytes. Note also that all sizes
are really 4 bytes less than the ones given below. For example the
maximum size of a fixed variable in netCDF 3.6 classic format is
really 2 GiB - 4 bytes.

<h3 class="section">4.4 NetCDF 64-bit Offset Format Limitations</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t64_002dbit-offset-format_002c-limitations-156"></a>
Although the 64-bit offset format allows the creation of much larger
netCDF files than was possible with the classic format, there are
still some restrictions on the size of variables.

   <p>It's important to note that without Large File Support (LFS) in the
operating system, it's impossible to create any file larger than 2
GiBytes.  Assuming an operating system with LFS, the following
restrictions apply to the netCDF 64-bit offset format.

   <p>No fixed-size variable can require more than 2^32 - 4 bytes (i.e. 4GiB
- 4 bytes, or 4,294,967,292 bytes) of storage for its data, unless it is the
last fixed-size variable and there are no record variables. When there
are no record variables, the last fixed-size variable can be any size
supported by the file system, e.g. terabytes.

   <p>A 64-bit offset format netCDF file can have up to 2^32 - 1 fixed sized
variables, each under 4GiB in size. If there are no record variables
in the file the last fixed variable can be any size.

   <p>No record variable can require more than 2^32 - 4 bytes of storage for
each record's worth of data, unless it is the last record variable. 
A 64-bit offset format netCDF file can have up to 2^32 - 1 records, of
up to 2^32 - 1 variables, as long as the size of one record's data for
each record variable except the last is less than 4 GiB - 4.

   <p>Note also that all netCDF variables and records are padded to 4 byte
boundaries.

<h3 class="section">4.5 NetCDF Classic Format Limitations</h3>

<p><a name="index-classic-format_002c-limitations-157"></a>
There are important constraints on the structure of large netCDF
classic files that result from the 32-bit relative offsets that are
part of the netCDF classic file format:

   <p>The maximum size of a record in the classic format in versions 3.5.1
and earlier is 2^32 - 4 bytes, or about 4 GiB.  In versions 3.6.0 and
later, there is no such restriction on total record size for the classic
format or 64-bit offset format.

   <p>The maximum size of a record in the classic format in versions 3.5.1
and earlier is 2^32 - 4 bytes, or about 4 GiB.  In versions 3.6.0 and
later, there is no such restriction on total record size for the classic
format or 64-bit offset format.

   <p>If you don't use the unlimited dimension, only one variable can exceed
2 GiB in size, but it can be as large as the underlying file system
permits. It must be the last variable in the dataset, and the offset
to the beginning of this variable must be less than about 2
GiB.

   <p>The limit is really 2^31 - 4.  If you were to specify a variable
size of 2^31 -3, for example, it would be rounded up to the nearest
multiple of 4 bytes, which would be 2^31, which is larger than the
largest signed integer, 2^31 - 1.

   <p>For example, the structure of the data might be something like:

<pre class="example">     netcdf bigfile1 {
         dimensions:
            x=2000;
            y=5000;
            z=10000;
         variables:
            double x(x);         // coordinate variables
            double y(y);
            double z(z);
            double var(x, y, z); // 800 Gbytes
         }
</pre>
   <p>If you use the unlimited dimension, record variables may
exceed 2 GiB in size, as long as the offset of the start of each
record variable within a record is less than 2 GiB - 4. For
example, the structure of the data in a 2.4 Tbyte file might be
something like:

<pre class="example">     netcdf bigfile2 {
         dimensions:
            x=2000;
            y=5000;
            z=10;
            t=UNLIMITED;         // 1000 records, for example
         variables:
            double x(x);         // coordinate variables
            double y(y);
            double z(z);
            double t(t);
                                 // 3 record variables, 2400000000 bytes per record
            double var1(t, x, y, z);
            double var2(t, x, y, z);
            double var3(t, x, y, z);
         }

<h3 class="section">4.6 The NetCDF-3 I/O Layer</h3>

<p><a name="index-I_002fO-layer-158"></a><a name="index-access-shared-dataset-I_002fO-159"></a><a name="index-shared-dataset-I_002fO-access-160"></a><a name="index-buffers_002c-I_002fO-161"></a><a name="index-NC_005fSHARE-162"></a><a name="index-NF_005fSHARE-163"></a><a name="index-share-flag-164"></a><a name="index-NF_005fSYNC-165"></a><a name="index-nc_005fsync-166"></a><a name="index-fflush-167"></a><a name="index-flushing-buffers-168"></a><a name="index-g_t_005fIONBF-flag-169"></a>

   <p>For netCDF classic and 64-bit offset files, an I/O layer implemented
much like the C standard I/O (stdio) library is used by netCDF to read
and write portable data to netCDF datasets. Hence an understanding of
the standard I/O library provides answers to many questions about
multiple processes accessing data concurrently, the use of I/O
buffers, and the costs of opening and closing netCDF files. In
particular, it is possible to have one process writing a netCDF
dataset while other processes read it.

   <p>Data reads and writes are no more atomic than calls to stdio fread()
and fwrite(). An nc_sync/NF_SYNC call is analogous to the fflush call
in the C standard I/O library, writing unwritten buffered data so
other processes can read it; The C function nc_sync (see <a href="netcdf-c.html#nc_005fsync">nc_sync</a>), or the Fortran function NF_SYNC
(see <a href="netcdf-f77.html#NF_005fSYNC">NF_SYNC</a>), also brings header
changes up-to-date (for example, changes to attribute values). Opening
the file with the NC_SHARE (in C) or the NF_SHARE (in Fortran) is
analogous to setting a stdio stream to be unbuffered with the _IONBF
flag to setvbuf.

   <p>As in the stdio library, flushes are also performed when "seeks" occur
to a different area of the file. Hence the order of read and write
operations can influence I/O performance significantly. Reading data
in the same order in which it was written within each record will
minimize buffer flushes.

   <p>You should not expect netCDF classic or 64-bit offset format data
access to work with multiple writers having the same file open for
writing simultaneously.

   <p>It is possible to tune an implementation of netCDF for some platforms
by replacing the I/O layer with a different platform-specific I/O
layer. This may change the similarities between netCDF and standard
I/O, and hence characteristics related to data sharing, buffering, and
the cost of I/O operations.

   <p>The distributed netCDF implementation is meant to be
portable. Platform-specific ports that further optimize the
implementation for better I/O performance are practical in some cases.

<h3 class="section">4.7 UNICOS Optimization</h3>

<p><a name="index-UNICOS-170"></a><a name="index-NETCDF_005fFFIOSPEC-171"></a>
It should be noted that no UNICOS platform has been available at
Unidata for netCDF testing for some years. The following information
is left here for historical reasons.

   <p>As was mentioned in the previous section, it is possible to replace
the I/O layer in order to increase I/O efficiency. This has been done
for UNICOS, the operating system of Cray computers similar to the Cray
Y-MP.

   <p>Additionally, it is possible for the user to obtain even greater I/O
efficiency through appropriate setting of the NETCDF_FFIOSPEC
environment variable. This variable specifies the Flexible File I/O
buffers for netCDF I/O when executing under the UNICOS operating
system (the variable is ignored on other operating systems). An
appropriate specification can greatly increase the efficiency of
netCDF I/O&ndash;to the extent that it can surpass default FORTRAN binary
I/O. Possible specifications include the following:

     <dl>
<dt><code>bufa:336:2</code><dd>2, asynchronous, I/O buffers of 336 blocks each (i.e., double
buffering). This is the default specification and favors sequential
I/O.

     <br><dt><code>cache:256:8</code><dd>8, synchronous, 256-block buffers. This favors larger random accesses.

     <br><dt><code>cachea:256:8:2</code><dd>8, asynchronous, 256-block buffers with a 2 block
read-ahead/write-behind factor. This also favors larger random
accesses.

     <br><dt><code>cachea:8:256:0</code><dd>256, asynchronous, 8-block buffers without
read-ahead/write-behind. This favors many smaller pages without
read-ahead for more random accesses as typified by slicing netCDF
arrays.

     <br><dt><code>cache:8:256,cachea.sds:1024:4:1</code><dd>This is a two layer cache. The first (synchronous) layer is composed
of 256 8-block buffers in memory, the second (asynchronous) layer is
composed of 4 1024-block buffers on the SSD. This scheme works well
when accesses proceed through the dataset in random waves roughly
2x1024-blocks wide.

   </dl>

   <p>All of the options/configurations supported in CRI's FFIO library are
available through this mechanism. We recommend that you look at CRI's
I/O optimization guide for information on using FFIO to its
fullest. This mechanism is also compatible with CRI's EIE I/O library.

   <p>Tuning the NETCDF_FFIOSPEC variable to a program's I/O pattern can
dramatically improve performance. Speedups of two orders of magnitude
have been seen.

One of the primary reasons for using the netCDF interface for
applications that deal with arrays is to take advantage of
higher-level netCDF utilities and generic applications for netCDF
data. Currently two netCDF utilities are available as part of the
netCDF software distribution:

     <dl>
<dt><code>ncdump</code><dd>reads a netCDF dataset and prints a textual representation of
the information in the dataset

     <br><dt><code>ncgen</code><dd>reads a textual representation of a netCDF dataset and generates
the corresponding binary netCDF file or a C or FORTRAN program to
create the netCDF dataset

   </dl>

   <p>Users have contributed other netCDF utilities, and various
visualization and analysis packages are available that access netCDF
data. For an up-to-date list of freely-available and commercial
software that can access or manipulate netCDF data, see the NetCDF
Software list,
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdfsoftware.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdfsoftware.html</a>.

   <p>This chapter describes the ncgen and ncdump utilities. These two tools
convert between binary netCDF datasets and a text representation of
netCDF datasets. The output of ncdump and the input to ncgen is a text
description of a netCDF dataset in a tiny language known as CDL
(network Common data form Description Language).

</pre>
   <p>All CDL statements are terminated by a semicolon. Spaces, tabs, and
newlines can be used freely for readability. Comments may follow the
double slash characters // on any line.

   <p>A CDL description consists of three optional parts: dimensions,
variables, and data. The variable part may contain variable
declarations and attribute assignments.

   <p>A dimension is used to define the shape of one or more of the
multidimensional variables described by the CDL description. A
dimension has a name and a length. At most one dimension in a CDL
description can have the unlimited length, which means a variable
using this dimension can grow to any length (like a record number in a
file).

   <p>A variable represents a multidimensional array of values of the same
type. A variable has a name, a data type, and a shape described by its
list of dimensions. Each variable may also have associated attributes
(see below) as well as data values. The name, data type, and shape of
a variable are specified by its declaration in the variable section of
a CDL description. A variable may have the same name as a dimension;
by convention such a variable contains coordinates of the dimension it
names.

   <p>An attribute contains information about a variable or about the whole
netCDF dataset. Attributes may be used to specify such properties as
units, special values, maximum and minimum valid values, and packing
parameters. Attribute information is represented by single values or
arrays of values. For example, units is an attribute represented by a
character array such as celsius. An attribute has an associated
variable, a name, a data type, a length, and a value. In contrast to
variables that are intended for data, attributes are intended for
ancillary data (data about data).

   <p>In CDL, an attribute is designated by a variable and attribute name,
separated by a colon (':'). It is possible to assign global attributes
to the netCDF dataset as a whole by omitting the variable name and
beginning the attribute name with a colon (':'). The data type of an
attribute in CDL is derived from the type of the value assigned to
it. The length of an attribute is the number of data values or the
number of characters in the character string assigned to it. Multiple
values are assigned to non-character attributes by separating the
values with commas (','). All values assigned to an attribute must be
of the same type.

   <p>CDL names for variables, attributes, and dimensions may be any
combination of alphabetic or numeric characters as well as '_' and '-'
characters, but names beginning with '_' are reserved for use by the
library. Case is significant in CDL names. The netCDF library does not
enforce any restrictions on netCDF names, so it is possible (though
unwise) to define variables with names that are not valid CDL
names. The names for the primitive data types are reserved words in
CDL, so the names of variables, dimensions, and attributes must not be
type names.

   <p>The optional data section of a CDL description is where netCDF
variables may be initialized. The syntax of an initialization is
simple:

<pre class="example">     variable = value_1, value_2, ...;
</pre>
   <p>The comma-delimited list of constants may be separated by spaces,
tabs, and newlines. For multidimensional arrays, the last dimension
varies fastest. Thus, row-order rather than column order is used for
matrices. If fewer values are supplied than are needed to fill a
variable, it is extended with the fill value. The types of constants
need not match the type declared for a variable; coercions are done to
convert integers to floating point, for example. All meaningful type
conversions are supported.

   <p>A special notation for fill values is supported: the _ character
designates a fill value for variables.

The CDL data types are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>char</code><a name="index-char-197"></a><dd>Characters.

     <br><dt><code>byte</code><a name="index-byte-198"></a><dd>Eight-bit integers.

     <br><dt><code>double</code><a name="index-double-204"></a><dd>IEEE double-precision floating point (64 bits). 
</dl>

   <p>Except for the added data-type byte and the lack of the type qualifier
unsigned, CDL supports the same primitive data types as C. In
declarations, type names may be specified in either upper or lower
case.

   <p>The byte type differs from the char type in that it is intended for
eight-bit data, and the zero byte has no special significance, as it
may for character data. The ncgen utility converts byte declarations
to char declarations in the output C code and to BYTE, INTEGER*1, or
similar platform-specific declaration in output FORTRAN code.

   <p>The short type holds values between -32768 and 32767. The ncgen
utility converts short declarations to short declarations in the
output C code and to INTEGER*2 declaration in output FORTRAN code.

   <p>The ushort type is an unsigned short type. It holds values between 0
and 65536.

   <p>The int type can hold values between -2147483648 and 2147483647. The
ncgen utility converts int declarations to int declarations in the
output C code and to INTEGER declarations in output FORTRAN code. In
CDL declarations integer and long are accepted as synonyms for int.

   <p>The uint type is an unsigned int type. It holds values between 0 and
4294967296.

   <p>The int64 is an 8-byte signed integer. It can hold values between
-9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807.

   <p>The uint64 is an unsigned 8-byte integer type. It can hold values
between 0 and 18446744073709551616.

   <p>The float type can hold values between about -3.4+38 and 3.4+38, with
external representation as 32-bit IEEE normalized single-precision
floating-point numbers. The ncgen utility converts float declarations
to float declarations in the output C code and to REAL declarations in
output FORTRAN code. In CDL declarations real is accepted as a synonym
for float.

   <p>The double type can hold values between about -1.7+308 and 1.7+308,
with external representation as 64-bit IEEE standard normalized
double-precision, floating-point numbers. The ncgen utility converts
double declarations to double declarations in the output C code and to
DOUBLE PRECISION declarations in output FORTRAN code.

   <p>The string type holds variable length strings.

   <p>The bool type holds boolean values.

This section describes the CDL notation for constants.

   <p>Attributes are initialized in the variables section of a CDL
description by providing a list of constants that determines the
attribute's type and length. (In the C and FORTRAN procedural
interfaces to the netCDF library, the type and length of an attribute
must be explicitly provided when it is defined.) CDL defines a syntax
for constant values that permits distinguishing among different netCDF
types. The syntax for CDL constants is similar to C syntax, except
that type suffixes are appended to shorts and floats to distinguish
them from ints and doubles.

   <p>A byte constant is represented by a single character or multiple
character escape sequence enclosed in single quotes. For example:

<pre class="example">     'a'     // ASCII a
     '\0'    // a zero byte
     '\n'    // ASCII newline character
     '\33'   // ASCII escape character (33 octal)
     '\x2b'  // ASCII plus (2b hex)
     '\376'  // 377 octal = -127 (or 254) decimal
</pre>
   <p>Character constants are enclosed in double quotes. A character array
may be represented as a string enclosed in double quotes. Multiple
strings are concatenated into a single array of characters, permitting
long character arrays to appear on multiple lines. To support multiple
variable-length string values, a conventional delimiter such as ','
may be used, but interpretation of any such convention for a string
delimiter must be implemented in software above the netCDF library
layer. The usual escape conventions for C strings are honored. For
example:

<pre class="example">     "a"            // ASCII 'a'
     "Two\nlines\n" // a 10-character string with two embedded newlines
     "a bell:\007"  // a string containing an ASCII bell
     "ab","cde"     // the same as "abcde"
</pre>
   <p>The form of a short constant is an integer constant with an 's' or 'S'
appended. If a short constant begins with '0', it is interpreted as
octal. When it begins with '0x', it is interpreted as a hexadecimal
constant. For example:

<pre class="example">     2s      // a short 2
     0123s   // octal
     0x7ffs  // hexadecimal
</pre>
   <p>The form of an int constant is an ordinary integer constant. If an int
constant begins with '0', it is interpreted as octal. When it begins
with '0x', it is interpreted as a hexadecimal constant. Examples of
valid int constants include:

<pre class="example">     -2
     0123            // octal
     0x7ff           // hexadecimal
     1234567890L     // deprecated, uses old long suffix
</pre>
   <p>The float type is appropriate for representing data with about seven
significant digits of precision. The form of a float constant is the
same as a C floating-point constant with an 'f' or 'F' appended. A
decimal point is required in a CDL float to distinguish it from an
integer. For example, the following are all acceptable float
constants:

<pre class="example">     -2.0f
     3.14159265358979f       // will be truncated to less precision
     1.f
     .1f
</pre>
   <p>The double type is appropriate for representing floating-point data
with about 16 significant digits of precision. The form of a double
constant is the same as a C floating-point constant. An optional 'd'
or 'D' may be appended. A decimal point is required in a CDL double to
distinguish it from an integer. For example, the following are all
acceptable double constants:

<pre class="example">     -2.0
     3.141592653589793
     1.0e-20
     1.d

The ncgen tool generates a netCDF file or a C or FORTRAN program that
creates a netCDF dataset. If no options are specified in invoking
ncgen, the program merely checks the syntax of the CDL input,
producing error messages for any violations of CDL syntax.

   <p>UNIX syntax for invoking ncgen:

<pre class="example">     ncgen [-b] [-o netcdf-file] [-c] [-f] [-k kind] [-x] [input-file]
</pre>
   <p>where:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-b</code><dd>Create a (binary) netCDF file. If the '-o' option is absent, a default
file name will be constructed from the netCDF name (specified after
the netcdf keyword in the input) by appending the '.nc'
extension. Warning: if a file already exists with the specified name
it will be overwritten.

     <br><dt><code>-o netcdf-file</code><dd>Name for the netCDF file created. If this option is specified, it
implies the '-b' option. (This option is necessary because netCDF
files are direct-access files created with seek calls, and hence
cannot be written to standard output.)

     <br><dt><code>-c</code><dd>Generate C source code that will create a netCDF dataset matching the
netCDF specification. The C source code is written to standard
output. This is only useful for relatively small CDL files, since all
the data is included in variable initializations in the generated
program.

     <br><dt><code>-f</code><dd>Generate FORTRAN source code that will create a netCDF dataset
matching the netCDF specification. The FORTRAN source code is written
to standard output. This is only useful for relatively small CDL
files, since all the data is included in variable initializations in
the generated program.

     <br><dt><code>-k kind</code><dd>The generated netCDF file or program will be of the specified kind,
one of &ldquo;classic&rdquo;, &ldquo;64-bit-offset&rdquo;, &ldquo;hdf5&rdquo;, or &ldquo;hdf5-nc3&rdquo;.  The
default kind is &ldquo;classic&rdquo;, the original variant of the netCDF file
format with 32-bit offsets, limiting file sizes in most cases to 2 GiB
or less.  The kind &ldquo;64-bit-offset&rdquo; specifies the second version of
the file format with 64-bit offsets, to allow for the creation of very
large files.  These files are not as portable as classic format netCDF
files, because they require version 3.6.0 or later of the netCDF
library.  Specifying &ldquo;hdf5&rdquo; will produce a file using the netCDF-4
programming interfaces (not yet implemented), and is required if the
CDL input includes features of the netCDF-4 data model, such as Groups
or compound types.  Specifying &ldquo;hdf5-nc3&rdquo; will create an HDF5 file
using the netCDF-4 interfaces (not yet implemented), but restricted to
the netCDF-3 data model, so that the file can be accessed and
manipulated by unmodified netCDF-2 or netCDF-3 programs and utilities
that have been relinked with the netCDF-4 library.  These four kinds
of files may also be specified numerically using &ldquo;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;2&rdquo;, &ldquo;3&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;4&rdquo;, respectively.  For backward comapatibility, `-v kind' is
also accepted.

     <br><dt><code>-x</code><dd>Use &ldquo;no fill&rdquo; mode, omitting the initialization of variable values
with fill values.  This can make the creation of large files much
faster, but it will also eliminate the possibility of detecting the
inadvertent reading of values that haven't been written. 
</dl>

<h3 class="heading">Examples</h3>

<p>Check the syntax of the CDL file foo.cdl:

<pre class="example">     ncgen foo.cdl
</pre>
   <p>From the CDL file foo.cdl, generate an equivalent binary netCDF file
named bar.nc:

<pre class="example">     ncgen -o bar.nc foo.cdl

   <p>From the CDL file foo.cdl, generate a C program containing netCDF
function invocations that will create an equivalent binary netCDF

<h3 class="section">5.5 ncdump</h3>

<p><a name="index-ncdump-218"></a>
The ncdump tool generates the CDL text representation of a netCDF
dataset on standard output, optionally excluding some or all of the
variable data in the output. The output from ncdump is intended to be
acceptable as input to ncgen. Thus ncdump and ncgen can be used as
inverses to transform data representation between binary and text
representations.

   <p>ncdump may also be used as a simple browser for netCDF datasets, to
display the dimension names and lengths; variable names, types, and
shapes; attribute names and values; and optionally, the values of data
for all variables or selected variables in a netCDF dataset.  Another
use for ncdump is to determine what kind of netCDF file is used
(which variant of the netCDF file format).

   <p>ncdump defines a default format used for each type of netCDF variable
data, but this can be overridden if a C_format attribute is defined
for a netCDF variable. In this case, ncdump will use the C_format
attribute to format values for that variable. For example, if
floating-point data for the netCDF variable Z is known to be accurate
to only three significant digits, it might be appropriate to use this
variable attribute:

<pre class="example">     Z:C_format = "%.3g"
</pre>
   <p>ncdump uses '_' to represent data values that are equal to the
_FillValue attribute for a variable, intended to represent data that
has not yet been written. If a variable has no _FillValue attribute,
the default fill value for the variable type is used unless the
variable is of byte type.

   <p>UNIX syntax for invoking ncdump:

<pre class="example">     ncdump  [ -c | -h]  [-v var1,...]  [-b lang]  [-f lang]
     [-l len]  [ -p fdig[,ddig]]  [ -n name] [-k]  [input-file]
</pre>
   <p>where:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-c</code><dd>Show the values of coordinate variables (variables that are also
dimensions) as well as the declarations of all dimensions, variables,
and attribute values. Data values of non-coordinate variables are not
included in the output. This is often the most suitable option to use
for a brief look at the structure and contents of a netCDF dataset.

     <br><dt><code>-h</code><dd>Show only the header information in the output, that is, output only
the declarations for the netCDF dimensions, variables, and attributes
of the input file, but no data values for any variables. The output is
identical to using the '-c' option except that the values of
coordinate variables are not included. (At most one of '-c' or '-h'
options may be present.)

     <br><dt><code>-v var1,...</code><dd>The output will include data values for the specified variables, in
addition to the declarations of all dimensions, variables, and
attributes. One or more variables must be specified by name in the
comma-delimited list following this option. The list must be a single
argument to the command, hence cannot contain blanks or other white
space characters. The named variables must be valid netCDF variables
in the input-file. The default, without this option and in the absence
of the '-c' or '-h' options, is to include data values for all
variables in the output.

     <br><dt><code>-b lang</code><dd>A brief annotation in the form of a CDL comment (text beginning with
the characters '//') will be included in the data section of the
output for each 'row' of data, to help identify data values for
multidimensional variables. If lang begins with 'C' or 'c', then C
language conventions will be used (zero-based indices, last dimension
varying fastest). If lang begins with 'F' or 'f', then FORTRAN
language conventions will be used (one-based indices, first dimension
varying fastest). In either case, the data will be presented in the
same order; only the annotations will differ. This option may be
useful for browsing through large volumes of multidimensional data.

     <br><dt><code>-f lang</code><dd>Full annotations in the form of trailing CDL comments (text beginning
with the characters '//') for every data value (except individual
characters in character arrays) will be included in the data
section. If lang begins with 'C' or 'c', then C language conventions
will be used (zero-based indices, last dimension varying fastest). If
lang begins with 'F' or 'f', then FORTRAN language conventions will be
used (one-based indices, first dimension varying fastest). In either
case, the data will be presented in the same order; only the
annotations will differ. This option may be useful for piping data
into other filters, since each data value appears on a separate line,
fully identified. (At most one of '-b' or '-f' options may be
present.)

     <br><dt><code>-l len</code><dd>Changes the default maximum line length (80) used in formatting lists
of non-character data values.

     <br><dt><code>-p float_digits[,double_digits]</code><dd>Specifies default precision (number of significant digits) to use in
displaying floating-point or double precision data values for
attributes and variables. If specified, this value overrides the value
of the C_format attribute, if any, for a variable. Floating-point data
will be displayed with float_digits significant digits. If
double_digits is also specified, double-precision values will be
displayed with that many significant digits. In the absence of any
'-p' specifications, floating-point and double-precision data are
displayed with 7 and 15 significant digits respectively. CDL files can
be made smaller if less precision is required. If both floating-point
and double precisions are specified, the two values must appear
separated by a comma (no blanks) as a single argument to the command.

     <br><dt><code>-n name</code><dd>CDL requires a name for a netCDF dataset, for use by 'ncgen -b' in
generating a default netCDF dataset name. By default, ncdump
constructs this name from the last component of the file name of the
input netCDF dataset by stripping off any extension it has. Use the
'-n' option to specify a different name. Although the output file name
used by 'ncgen -b' can be specified, it may be wise to have ncdump
change the default name to avoid inadvertently overwriting a valuable
netCDF dataset when using ncdump, editing the resulting CDL file, and
using 'ncgen -b' to generate a new netCDF dataset from the edited CDL
file.

     <br><dt><code>-k</code><dd>Show what kind of netCDF file input-file is, one of
'classic', '64-bit-offset','hdf5', or 'hdf5-nc3'.  Before version
3.6, there was only one kind of netCDF file, designated as 'classic'
(also know as format variant 1).  Large file support introduced
another variant of the format, designated as '64-bit-offset' (known as
format variant 2).  NetCDF-4, uses a third variant of the format,
'hdf5' (format variant 3).  Another format variant, designated
'hdf5-classic' (format variant 4), is restricted
to features supported by the netCDF-3 data model but represented using
the HDF5 format, so that an unmodified netCDF-3 program can read or
write the file just by relinking with the netCDF-4 library. 
The string output by using the '-k' option may be provided as the
value of the '-k' option to ncgen(1) to
specify exactly what kind of netCDF file to generate, when you want to
override the default inferred from the CDL.

<p><a name="index-units-library-219"></a><a name="index-udunits-220"></a><a name="index-applications_002c-generic_002c-units-221"></a>
The Unidata Program Center has developed a units library to convert
between formatted and binary forms of units specifications and perform
unit algebra on the binary form. Though the units library is
self-contained and there is no dependency between it and the netCDF
library, it is nevertheless useful in writing generic netCDF programs
and we suggest you obtain it. The library and associated documentation
is available from <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/</a>.

   <p>The following are examples of units strings that can be interpreted by
the utScan() function of the Unidata units library:

<pre class="example">     10 kilogram.meters/seconds2
     10 kg-m/sec2
     10 kg m/s^2
     10 kilogram meter second-2
     (PI radian)2
     degF
     100rpm
     geopotential meters
     33 feet water
     milliseconds since 1992-12-31 12:34:0.1 -7:00
</pre>
   <p>A unit is specified as an arbitrary product of constants and
unit-names raised to arbitrary integral powers. Division is indicated
by a slash '/'. Multiplication is indicated by white space, a period
'.', or a hyphen '-'. Exponentiation is indicated by an integer suffix
or by the exponentiation operators '^' and '**'. Parentheses may be
used for grouping and disambiguation. The time stamp in the last
example is handled as a special case.

   <p>Arbitrary Galilean transformations (i.e., y = ax + b) are allowed. In
particular, temperature conversions are correctly handled. The
specification:

<pre class="example">     degF  32
</pre>
   <p>indicates a Fahrenheit scale with the origin shifted to thirty-two
degrees Fahrenheit (i.e., to zero Celsius). Thus, the Celsius scale is
equivalent to the following unit:

<pre class="example">     1.8 degF  32
</pre>
   <p>Note that the origin-shift operation takes precedence over
multiplication. In order of increasing precedence, the operations are
division, multiplication, origin-shift, and exponentiation.

   <p>utScan() understands all the SI prefixes (e.g. "mega" and "milli")
plus their abbreviations (e.g. "M" and "m")

   <p>The function utPrint() always encodes a unit specification one way. To
reduce misunderstandings, it is recommended that this encoding style
be used as the default. In general, a unit is encoded in terms of
basic units, factors, and exponents. Basic units are separated by
spaces, and any exponent directly appends its associated unit. The
above examples would be encoded as follows:

<pre class="example">     10 kilogram meter second-2
     9.8696044 radian2
     0.555556 kelvin  255.372
     10.471976 radian second-1
     9.80665 meter2 second-2
     98636.5 kilogram meter-1 second-2
     0.001 seconds since 1992-12-31 19:34:0.1000 UTC
</pre>
   <p>(Note that the Fahrenheit unit is encoded as a deviation, in
fractional kelvins, from an origin at 255.372 kelvin, and that the
time in the last example has been referenced to UTC.)

   <p>The database for the units library is a formatted file containing unit
definitions and is used to initialize this package. It is the first
place to look to discover the set of valid names and symbols.

   <p>The format for the units-file is documented internally and the file
may be modified by the user as necessary. In particular, additional
units and constants may be easily added (including variant spellings
of existing units or constants).

   <p>utScan() is case-sensitive. If this causes difficulties, you might try
making appropriate additional entries to the units-file.

   <p>Some unit abbreviations in the default units-file might seem
counterintuitive. In particular, note the following:

   <p><table summary="">

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B Attribute Conventions</h2>

<p><a name="index-attribute-conventions-222"></a><a name="index-applications_002c-generic_002c-conventions-223"></a><a name="index-conventions_002c-attributes-224"></a>
Names commencing with underscore ('_') are reserved for use by the
netCDF library. Most generic applications that process netCDF datasets
assume standard attribute conventions and it is strongly recommended
that these be followed unless there are good reasons for not doing
so. Below we list the names and meanings of recommended standard
attributes that have proven useful. Note that some of these
(e.g. units, valid_range, scale_factor) assume numeric data and should
not be used with character data.

     <dl>
<dt><code>units</code><a name="index-units-225"></a><dd>A character string that specifies the units used for the variable's
data. Unidata has developed a freely-available library of routines to
convert between character string and binary forms of unit
specifications and to perform various useful operations on the binary
forms. This library is used in some netCDF applications. Using the
recommended units syntax permits data represented in conformable units
to be automatically converted to common units for arithmetic
operations. For more information see <a href="#Units">Units</a>.

     <br><dt><code>long_name</code><a name="index-long_005fname-226"></a><dd>A long descriptive name. This could be used for labeling plots, for
example. If a variable has no long_name attribute assigned, the
variable name should be used as a default.

     <br><dt><code>valid_min</code><a name="index-valid_005fmin-227"></a><dd>A scalar specifying the minimum valid value for this variable.

     <br><dt><code>valid_max</code><a name="index-valid_005fmax-228"></a><dd>A scalar specifying the maximum valid value for this variable.

     <br><dt><code>valid_range</code><a name="index-valid_005frange-229"></a><dd>A vector of two numbers specifying the minimum and maximum valid
values for this variable, equivalent to specifying values for both
valid_min and valid_max attributes. Any of these attributes define the
valid range. The attribute valid_range must not be defined if either
valid_min or valid_max is defined.

     <p>Generic applications should treat values outside the valid range as
missing. The type of each valid_range, valid_min and valid_max
attribute should match the type of its variable (except that for byte
data, these can be of a signed integral type to specify the intended
range).

     <p>If neither valid_min, valid_max nor valid_range is defined then
generic applications should define a valid range as follows. If the
data type is byte and _FillValue is not explicitly defined, then the
valid range should include all possible values. Otherwise, the valid
range should exclude the _FillValue (whether defined explicitly or by
default) as follows. If the _FillValue is positive then it defines a
valid maximum, otherwise it defines a valid minimum. For integer
types, there should be a difference of 1 between the _FillValue and
this valid minimum or maximum. For floating point types, the
difference should be twice the minimum possible (1 in the least
significant bit) to allow for rounding error.

     <br><dt><code>scale_factor</code><a name="index-scale_005ffactor-230"></a><dd>If present for a variable, the data are to be multiplied by this
factor after the data are read by the application that accesses the
data.

     <br><dt><code>add_offset</code><a name="index-add_005foffset-231"></a><dd>If present for a variable, this number is to be added to the data
after it is read by the application that accesses the data. If both
scale_factor and add_offset attributes are present, the data are first
scaled before the offset is added. The attributes scale_factor and
add_offset can be used together to provide simple data compression to
store low-resolution floating-point data as small integers in a netCDF
dataset. When scaled data are written, the application should first
subtract the offset and then divide by the scale factor, rounding the
result to the nearest integer to avoid a bias caused by truncation
towards zero.

     <p>When scale_factor and add_offset are used for packing, the associated
variable (containing the packed data) is typically of type byte or
short, whereas the unpacked values are intended to be of type float or
double. The attributes scale_factor and add_offset should both be of
the type intended for the unpacked data, e.g. float or double.

     <br><dt><code>_FillValue</code><a name="index-g_t_005fFillValue-232"></a><dd>The _FillValue attribute specifies the fill value used to pre-fill
disk space allocated to the variable. Such pre-fill occurs unless
nofill mode is set using nc_set_fill in C (see <a href="netcdf-c.html#nc_005fset_005ffill">nc_set_fill</a>) or NF_SET_FILL in Fortran
(see <a href="netcdf-f77.html#NF_005fSET_005fFILL">NF_SET_FILL</a>). The fill value
is returned when reading values that were never written. If _FillValue
is defined then it should be scalar and of the same type as the
variable. It is not necessary to define your own _FillValue attribute
for a variable if the default fill value for the type of the variable
is adequate. However, use of the default fill value for data type byte
is not recommended. Note that if you change the value of this
attribute, the changed value applies only to subsequent writes;
previously written data are not changed.

     <p>Generic applications often need to write a value to represent
undefined or missing values. The fill value provides an appropriate
value for this purpose because it is normally outside the valid range
and therefore treated as missing when read by generic applications. It
is legal (but not recommended) for the fill value to be within the
valid range.

     <p>For more information for C programmers see <a href="netcdf-c.html#Fill-Values">Fill Values</a>. For more information for Fortran
programmers see <a href="netcdf-f77.html#Fill-Values">Fill Values</a>.

     <br><dt><code>missing_value</code><a name="index-missing_005fvalue-233"></a><dd>This attribute is not treated in any special way by the
library or conforming generic applications, but is often useful
documentation and may be used by specific applications. The
missing_value attribute can be a scalar or vector containing values
indicating missing data. These values should all be outside the valid
range so that generic applications will treat them as missing.

     <br><dt><code>signedness</code><a name="index-signedness-234"></a><dd>Deprecated attribute, originally designed to indicate whether byte
values should be treated as signed or unsigned. The attributes
valid_min and valid_max may be used for this purpose. For example, if
you intend that a byte variable store only nonnegative values, you can
use valid_min = 0 and valid_max = 255. This attribute is ignored by
the netCDF library.

     <br><dt><code>C_format</code><a name="index-C_005fformat-235"></a><dd>A character array providing the format that should be used by C
applications to print values for this variable. For example, if you
know a variable is only accurate to three significant digits, it would
be appropriate to define the C_format attribute as "%.3g". The ncdump
utility program uses this attribute for variables for which it is
defined. The format applies to the scaled (internal) type and value,
regardless of the presence of the scaling attributes scale_factor and
add_offset.

     <br><dt><code>FORTRAN_format</code><a name="index-FORTRAN_005fformat-236"></a><dd>A character array providing the format that should be used by FORTRAN
applications to print values for this variable. For example, if you
know a variable is only accurate to three significant digits, it would
be appropriate to define the FORTRAN_format attribute as "(G10.3)".

     <br><dt><code>title</code><a name="index-title-237"></a><dd>A global attribute that is a character array providing a succinct
description of what is in the dataset.

     <br><dt><code>history</code><a name="index-history-238"></a><dd>A global attribute for an audit trail. This is a character array with
a line for each invocation of a program that has modified the
dataset. Well-behaved generic netCDF applications should append a line
containing: date, time of day, user name, program name and command
arguments.

     <br><dt><code>Conventions</code><a name="index-Conventions-239"></a><dd>If present, 'Conventions' is a global attribute that is a character
array for the name of the conventions followed by the dataset, in the
form of a string that is interpreted as a directory name relative to a
directory that is a repository of documents describing sets of
discipline-specific conventions. This permits a hierarchical structure
for conventions and provides a place where descriptions and examples
of the conventions may be maintained by the defining institutions and
groups. The conventions directory name is currently interpreted
relative to the directory pub/netcdf/Conventions/ on the host machine
ftp.unidata.ucar.edu. Alternatively, a full URL specification may be
used to name a WWW site where documents that describe the conventions
are maintained.

     <p>For example, if a group named NUWG agrees upon a set of conventions
for dimension names, variable names, required attributes, and netCDF
representations for certain discipline-specific data structures, they
may store a document describing the agreed-upon conventions in a
dataset in the NUWG/ subdirectory of the Conventions
directory. Datasets that followed these conventions would contain a
global Conventions attribute with value "NUWG".

     <p>Later, if the group agrees upon some additional conventions for a
specific subset of NUWG data, for example time series data, the
description of the additional conventions might be stored in the
NUWG/Time_series/ subdirectory, and datasets that adhered to these
additional conventions would use the global Conventions attribute with
value "NUWG/Time_series", implying that this dataset adheres to the
NUWG conventions and also to the additional NUWG time-series
conventions.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix C File Format Specification</h2>

<p><a name="index-file-format-240"></a>
This appendix specifies the netCDF file format version 1 (netCDF
classic format).

   <p>NetCDF 64-bit offset format differs from netCDF classic only in that
the VERSION_BYTE = 2, and one of the internal offsets uses a 64-byte,
instead of a 31-byte, offset into the file.

   <p>The classic format is first presented formally, using a BNF grammar
notation. In the grammar, optional components are enclosed between
braces ('[' and ']'). Comments follow '//' characters. Nonterminals
are in lower case, and terminals are in upper case. A sequence of zero
or more occurrences of an entity are denoted by '[entity ...]'.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The Classic Format in Detail</h4>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Computing File Offsets</h4>

<p>To calculate the offset (position within the file) of a specified data
value (in a classic format data file), let external_sizeof be the
external size in bytes of one data value of the appropriate type for
the specified variable, nc_type:

   <p>NC_BYTE         1
NC_CHAR         1
NC_SHORT        2
NC_INT          4
NC_FLOAT        4
NC_DOUBLE       8

   <p>On a call to nc_open (or nc_enddef), scan through the array of
variables, denoted var_array above, and sum the vsize fields of
"record" variables to compute recsize.

   <p>Form the products of the dimension lengths for the variable from right
to left, skipping the leftmost (record) dimension for record
variables, and storing the results in a product array for each
variable. For example:

   <p>Non-record variable:

   <p>dimension lengths:      [  5  3  2 7]
        product:                [210 42 14 7]

   <p>Record variable:

   <p>dimension lengths:      [0  2  9 4]
        product:                [0 72 36 4]

   <p>At this point, the leftmost product, when rounded up to the next
multiple of 4, is the variable size, vsize, in the grammar above. For
example, in the non-record variable above, the value of the vsize
field is 212 (210 rounded up to a multiple of 4). For the record
variable, the value of vsize is just 72, since this is already a
multiple of 4.

   <p>Let coord be an array of the coordinates of the desired data value,
and offset be the desired result. Then offset is just the file offset
of the first data value of the desired variable (its begin field)
added to the inner product of the coord and product vectors times the
size, in bytes, of each datum for the variable. Finally, if the
variable is a record variable, the product of the record number,
'coord[0]', and the record size, recsize is added to yield the final
offset value.

   <p>In pseudo-C code, here's the calculation of offset:

<pre class="example">     for (innerProduct = i = 0; i &lt; var.rank; i++)
             innerProduct += product[i] * coord[i]
     offset = var.begin;
     offset += external_sizeof * innerProduct
     if(IS_RECVAR(var))
             offset += coord[0] * recsize;
</pre>
   <p>So, to get the data value (in external representation):

<pre class="example">     lseek(fd, offset, SEEK_SET);
     read(fd, buf, external_sizeof);
</pre>
   <p>A special case: Where there is exactly one record variable, we drop
the restriction that each record be four-byte aligned, so in this case
there is no record padding.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Examples</h4>

<p>By using the grammar above, we can derive the smallest valid netCDF
file, having no dimensions, no variables, no attributes, and hence, no
data. A CDL representation of the empty netCDF file is

   <p>netcdf empty { }

   <p>This empty netCDF file has 32 bytes, as you may verify by using 'ncgen
-b empty.cdl' to generate it from the CDL representation. It begins
with the four-byte "magic number" that identifies it as a netCDF
version 1 file: 'C', 'D', 'F', '\001'. Following are seven 32-bit
integer zeros representing the number of records, an empty array of
dimensions, an empty array of global attributes, and an empty array of
variables.

   <p>Below is an (edited) dump of the file produced on a big-endian machine
using the Unix command

   <p>od -xcs empty.nc

   <p>Each 16-byte portion of the file is displayed with 4 lines. The first
line displays the bytes in hexadecimal. The second line displays the
bytes as characters. The third line displays each group of two bytes
interpreted as a signed 16-bit integer. The fourth line (added by
human) presents the interpretation of the bytes in terms of netCDF
components and values.

<pre class="example">        4344    4601    0000    0000    0000    0000    0000    0000

     [  0 global atts  (ABSENT)    ] [  0 variables    (ABSENT)    ]
</pre>
   <p>As a slightly less trivial example, consider the CDL

<pre class="example">     netcdf tiny {
     dimensions:
             dim = 5;
     variables:
             short vx(dim);
     data:
             vx = 3, 1, 4, 1, 5 ;
     }
</pre>
   <p>which corresponds to a 92-byte netCDF file. The following is an edited
dump of this file:
