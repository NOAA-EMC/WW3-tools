<h2 class="chapter">1 Installing the NetCDF Binaries</h2>

<p><a name="index-binary-install-1"></a><a name="index-installing-binary-distribution-2"></a><a name="index-shared-libraries_002c-using-3"></a>
Perhaps the easiest way to get netCDF is to get a pre-built binary
distribution. To get them, see <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/binaries.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/binaries.html</a>.

   <p>To install the binary distribution, uncompress and unpack the tar
file. You will end up with 4 subdirectories, lib, include, man, and
bin.

   <p>The lib subdirectory holds the netCDF libraries (C, Fortran, and
C++). The include directory holds the necessary netcdf.h file (for C),
netcdf.inc (for Fortran), netcdfcpp.h (for C++), and the .mod files
(for Fortran 90). The bin directory holds the ncgen and ncdump
utilities, and the man directory holds the netCDF documentation.

   <p>You can have these directories anywhere you like, and use netCDF. But
when compiling a netCDF program, you will have to tell the linker
where to find the library (e.g. with the -L option of most C
compilers), and you will also have to tell the C pre-processor where
to find the include file (e.g. with the -I option).

   <p>If you are using shared libraries, you will also have to specify the
library location for run-time dynamic linking. See your compiler
documentation. For some general information see the netCDF FAQ &ldquo;How
do I use shared libraries&rdquo; at <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/faq.html#using_shared_p">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/faq.html#using_shared_p</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Quick Instructions for Installing NetCDF on Unix</h2>

<p><a name="index-quick-unix-instructions-4"></a><a name="index-shared-libraries_002c-building-5"></a>
Who has time to read long installation manuals these days?

   <p>To install netCDF, uncompress and unpack the tar file, then change to
the distribution directory:

<pre class="example">     gunzip netcdf-3.6.2.tar.gz
     tar -xf netcdf-3.6.2.tar
     cd netcdf-3.6.2
</pre>
   <p>Now run the usual configure, make check, make install cycle:

<pre class="example">     ./configure
     make check
     make install
</pre>
   <p>The configure script will try to find necessary tools in your
path. When you run configure you may optionally use the &ndash;prefix
argument to change the default installation directory. For example,
the following will install the library in /usr/local/lib, the header
file in /usr/local/include, and the utilities in /usr/local/bin.

<pre class="example">     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
</pre>
   <p>The default install root is /usr/local (so there's no need to use the
prefix argument if you want the software installed there).

   <p>By default the netCDF configuration will build static libraries
only. For shared libraries as well, use the &ndash;enable-shared option to
configure.

   <p>If all this doesn't work, then you might have to read the next
chapter. Better luck next time!

Depending on the platform, you may need up to 25 Mbytes of free space
to unpack, build, and run the tests. You will also need a Standard C
compiler. If you have compilers for FORTRAN 77, FORTRAN 90, or C++,
the corresponding netCDF language interfaces may also be built and
tested. Compilers and associated tools will only be found if they are
in your path, or if you specify the path and compiler in the
appropriate environment variable. (Example for csh: setenv
CC=/some/directory/cc).

   <p>If you want to run the large file tests, you will need about 13 GB of
free disk space, as some very large files are created. The created
files are immediately deleted after the tests complete. These large
file tests are not run as part of the normal &ldquo;make check&rdquo; step; they are only
run if you use the &ndash;enable-large-file-tests option with configure.

   <p>If you wish to build from source on a Windows (Win32) platform,
different instructions apply. See <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Specifying the Environment for Building</h3>

<p>The netCDF configure script searches your path to find the compilers,
tools, and settings it needs to build netCDF. If you wish to change
the default choices of the configure script, you may do so by setting
environment variables.

   <p>Environment variables are a feature of Unix shells, and each shell may
handle them in a slightly different manner. (To see which shell you
are using, type: echo $SHELL).

   <p>For users of the C-shell (csh) and derived shells, use the setenv
command to set environment variables. For the Bourne shell (sh), use
the export command to set an environment variable.

   <p>For example, to use compilers that can't be found in your
path, set the appropriate CC, CXX, F77, or F90 environment
variables. In the Bourne shell:

<pre class="example">     export CC=/some/strange/place/cc
     export F77=/some/strange/place/f77
     ./configure
     make check
</pre>
   <p>To accomplish the same thing from the C-shell:

<pre class="example">     setenv CC /some/strange/place/cc
     setenv F77 /some/strange/place/f77
     ./configure
     make check
</pre>
   <p>When searching for compilers the configure script will prefer vendor
compilers to GNU compilers. Its not because we don't like GNU, but
because we assume if you purchased a compiler, you want to use
it. Setting CC allows you to over-ride this
preference. (Alternatively, you could temporarily remove the
compiler's directories from your PATH.)

   <p>For example, on an AIX system, configure will first search for xlc,
the AIX compiler. If not found, it will try gcc, the GNU compiler. To
override this behavior, set CC to gcc (in sh: export CC=gcc). (But
don't forget to also set CXX to g++, or else configure will try and
use xlC, the AIX C++ compiler to build the netCDF C++ API.)

   <p>By default, the netCDF library is built with assertions turned on. If
you wish to turn off assertions, set CPPFLAGS to -DNDEBUG (csh ex:
setenv CPPFLAGS -DNDEBUG).

   <p>If GNU compilers are used, the configure script sets CPPFLAGS to &ldquo;-g
-O2&rdquo;. If this is not desired, set CPPFLAGS to nothing, or to whatever
other value you wish to use, before running configure.

Some platforms support special options to build in 64-bit mode.

   <p>NetCDF 3.6.2 has been tested as 64-bit builds on SunOS,
Irix, and AIX. The options needed to build in 64-bit mode on these
platforms are described here, and can be turned on by providing the
&ndash;enable-64bit flag to configure.

     <dl>
<dt><code>AIX</code><dd>Set -q64 option in all compilers, and set NMFLAGS to -X64, and ARFLAGS
to '-X64 cru'. Alternatively, set environment variable OBJECT_MODE to
64 before running configure.

     <br><dt><code>IRIX</code><dd>Set the -64 option in all compilers.

     <br><dt><code>SunOS</code><dd>Use the -xarch=v9 flag on all compilers. This is not supported on the

To create the Makefiles needed to build netCDF, you must run the
provided configure script. Go to the top-level netCDF directory.

   <p>Decide where you want to install this package. Use this for the
"&ndash;prefix=" argument to the configure script below. The default
installation prefix is &ldquo;/usr/local,&rdquo; which will install the
package's files in usr/local/bin, usr/local/lib, and
usr/local/man. The default can be overridden with the &ndash;prefix
argument to configure.

   <p>(Note that this is a new default location for version 3.6.2 of
netCDF. Previous versions used the directory in which netCDF was built
as the default install directory).

   <p>Here's how to execute the configure script with a different
installation directory:

<pre class="example">         ./configure --prefix=/whatever/you/decided
</pre>
   <p>The above would cause the netCDF libraries to be installed in
/whatever/you/decided/lib, the header files in
/whatever/you/decided/include, the utilities (ncdump/ncgen) in
/whatever/you/decided/bin, and the man pages in
/whatever/you/decided/man.

   <p>There are other options for the configure script. The most useful ones
are listed below. Use the &ndash;help option to get the full list.

     <dl>
<dt><code>--prefix</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dprefix-20"></a><dd>Specify the directory under which netCDF will be
installed. Subdirectories lib, bin, include, and man will be created
there, if they don't already exist.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-shared</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dshared-21"></a><dd>Build shared libraries (as well as static) on platforms which support
them.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-docs-install</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002ddocs_002dinstall-22"></a><dd>If this option is used, the netCDF distribution will install all
documentation. NetCDF documents are provided in PDF, HTML,
postscript, info, and ASCII text.

     <p>You can change the directory that documents are installed to. Run
./configure &ndash;help for more information.

     <p>The this option does not affect the netCDF man
pages, which are always installed. This option applies only to the
texinfo documentation files in the man directory (netcdf.texi,
netcdf-c.texi, and so on).

     <p>The latest documentation is also available on-line at the the netCDF
website. <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf</a>.

     <p>Installing the documentation does not cause the documentation to be
built from source; it causes the documentation which was shipped with
the distribution to be installed.

     <p>Users who wish to contribute to the documentation development are
urged to make any suggested changes to the documentation source files,
which have the .texi filename extension (netcdf.text, netcdf-c.texi,
etc.). Building the netCDF documentation from source requires recent
versions of the open-source tools sed, m4, texinfo, and tex.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-flag-setting</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dflag_002dsetting-23"></a><dd>By default the configure script may change some compiler flags to
allow netCDF to build on your platform. If you wish to specify
compiler flags which conflict with the ones added by the configure
script, then use this option to instruct configure not to attempt to
set any compiler flags. It is then the responsibility of the user to
correctly set CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, etc. (Note that this flag does not
affect some setting of flags by configure for GNU platforms; it just
turns off any special netCDF flags).

     <br><dt><code>--enable-64bit</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002d64bit-24"></a><dd>Compile for 64-bit platform on Sun, AIX, HPUX, or Irix. (Has no effect
on other platforms). Since this works by setting some compiler flags,
this option is incompatible with &ndash;disable-flag-setting.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-largefile</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dlargefile-25"></a><dd>This omits OS support for large files (i.e. files larger than 2 GB).

     <br><dt><code>--disable-f77</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002df77-26"></a><dd>This turns off building of the F77 and F90 APIs. (The F90 API cannot
be built without the F77 API). This also disables some of the
configure tests that relate to fortran, including the test of the F90
compiler. Setting the environment variables FC or F77 to NULL will
have the same effect as &ndash;disable-f77.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-f90</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002df90-27"></a><dd>This turns off the building of the F90 API. Setting the environment
variable F90 to null for configure will have the same effect.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-cxx</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dcxx-28"></a><dd>This turns off the building of the C++ API. Setting the environment
variable CXX to null for configure will have the same effect.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-v2</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dv2-29"></a><dd>This turns of the V2 API. The V2 API is completely replaced with the
V3 API, but is usually built with netCDF for backwards compatibility,
and also because the C++ API depends on the V2 API. Setting this has
the effect of automatically turning of the CXX API, as if
&ndash;disable-cxx had also been specified.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-utilities</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dutilities-30"></a><dd>This turns off the building (and testing) of the netCDF utilities
ncgen and ncdump. This option is helpful when debugging library build
problems, but probably not of much use to the average user.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-c-only</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dc_002donly-31"></a><dd>This turns off the building (and testing) of everything except the
core netCDF-3 C library. This option is helpful when debugging library
build problems, but probably not of much use to the average user.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-large-file-tests</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dlarge_002dfile_002dtests-32"></a><dd>Turn on tests for large files. These tests create files over 2 GB in
size, and need about 13 GB of free disk space to run. These files are
deleted after the test successfully completes. They will be created in
the netCDF nc_test directory, unless the &ndash;with-temp-large option is
used to specify another location (see below).

     <br><dt><code>--with-temp-large</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dwith_002dtemp_002dlarge-33"></a><dd>Normally large files are not created during the netCDF build, but they
will be if &ndash;enable-large-file-tests is specified (see above). In that
case, this configure parameter can be used to specify a location to
create these large files, for example: &ndash;with-large-files=/tmp/ed.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-fortran-compiler-check</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dfortran_002dcompiler_002dcheck-34"></a><dd>Normally the netCDF configure checks the F77 and F90 compilers with
small test programs to see if they work. This is very helpful in
supporting netCDF installations on different machines, but won't work
with cross-compilation. Use the &ndash;disable-fortran-compiler-check to
turn off the fortran compiler tests, and just assume that the
compilers will work.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-fortran-type-check</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dfortran_002dtype_002dcheck-35"></a><dd>Normally configure checks the size of fortran types. This option turns
off those tests, and uses default values.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-compiler-recover</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dcompiler_002drecover-36"></a><dd>Normally, if the netCDF configure finds a F90 compiler, and it fails
to build the test program described in &ndash;disable-f90-check, it will
print a warning, and then continue to build without the F90 API, as if
the user has specified &ndash;disable-f90. With the
&ndash;disable-compiler-recover option set, it will not continue, but will
just stop if the fortran 90 compiler doesn't work. This is useful for
automatic testing, where we want the tests to fail if something causes
the fortran compiler to break.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-examples</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dexamples-37"></a><dd>Starting with version 3.6.2, netCDF comes with some examples in the
&ldquo;examples&rdquo; directory. By default, the examples are all built during
a &ldquo;make check&rdquo; unless the &ndash;disable-examples option is
provided. Note that the examples are not built for &ldquo;make install&rdquo;,
just for &ldquo;make check&rdquo;. As far as netCDF is concerned, the examples
are extra tests.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-separate-fortran</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dseparate_002dfortran-38"></a><dd>This will cause the Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 APIs to be built into
their own separate library, instead of being included in the C
library. This is useful for supporting more than one fortran compiler
with the same netCDF C library. This is turned on by default for
shared library builds.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-extreme-numbers</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dextreme_002dnumbers-39"></a><dd>In some netCDF test programs (nc_test.c and nf_test.F) there are tests
which use numbers at or just beyond the extreme number that can be
used for a type. (For example, using MAX_INT + 1 as an int type). This
causes problems on Solaris 386 systems. For that reason, the extreme
numbers are not used, by default, on Solaris 386 systems. This option
gives the user control to override the default. This affects only
netCDF test programs, not the netCDF library itself.

   </dl>

   <p>The configure script will examine your computer system &ndash; checking for
attributes that are relevant to building the netCDF package. It will
print to standard output the checks that it makes and the results that
it finds.

   <p>The configure script will also create the file "config.log", which
will contain error messages from the utilities that the configure
script uses in examining the attributes of your system. Because such
an examination can result in errors, it is expected that "config.log"
will contain error messages. Therefore, such messages do not
necessarily indicate a problem (a better indicator would be failure of
the subsequent "make"). One exception, however, is an error message in
"config.log" that indicates that a compiler could not be started. This
indicates a severe problem in your compilation environment &ndash; one that
you must fix.

Run "make". This will build one or more netCDF libraries. It will
build the basic netCDF library libnetcdf.a. If you have Fortran 77 or
Fortran 90 compilers, then the Fortran library will also be built
(libnetcdff.a). If you have a C++ compiler, then the C++ interface
will be built (libnetcdf_c++.a.)

   <p>A &ldquo;make&rdquo; will also build the netCDF utilities ncgen(1) and
ncdump(1).

Run &ldquo;make check&rdquo; to verify that the netCDF library and executables
have been built properly (you can instead run &ldquo;make test&rdquo; which does
the same thing).

   <p>A make check will build and run various test programs that test the C,
Fortran, and C++ interfaces as well as the "ncdump" and "ncgen"
utility programs.

   <p>Lines in the output beginning with "***" report on success or failure
of the tests; any failures will be reported before halting the
test. Compiler and linker warnings during the testing may be ignored.

   <p>Run the tests like this:

<pre class="example">     make check
</pre>
   <p>If you plan to use the 64-bit offset format (introduced in version
3.6.0) to create very large files (i.e. larger than 2 GB), you should
probably specify the &ndash;enable-large-file-tests to configure, which
tests the large file features. You must have 13 GB of free disk space
for these tests to successfully run.

   <p>If you are running the large file tests, you may wish to use the
&ndash;with-temp-large option to specify a temporary directory for the
large files. (You may also set the environment variable TEMP_LARGE
before running configure).

   <p>The default is to create the large files in the nc_test subdirectory
of the netCDF build.

   <p>Run the large file tests like this:

<pre class="example">     ./configure --enable-large-file-tests --with-temp-large=/home/ed/tmp
     make check
</pre>
   <p>All of the large files are removed on successful completion of
tests. If the test fails, you may wish to make sure that no large
files have been left around.

   <p>If any of the the large file tests test fail, check to ensure that
your file system can handle files larger than 2 GiB by running the
following command:

<pre class="example">     	dd if=/dev/zero bs=1000000 count=3000 of=$(TEMP_LARGE)/largefile
</pre>
   <p>If your system does not have a /dev/zero, this test will fail. Then
you need to find some other way to create a file larger than 2 GiB to
ensure that your system can handle them.

To install the libraries and executables, run "make install". This
will install to the directory specified in the configure step.

   <p>Run the installation like this:

<pre class="example">     make install
</pre>
   <p>The install will put files in the following subdirectories of the
directory you provided as a prefix, creating the subdirectories if
needed:

     <dl>
<dt><code>lib</code><dd>Libraries will be installed here. If static libraries are built,
without separate fortran libraries, then libnetcdf.a and libnetcdf.la
will be installed. If the C++ API is built, libnetcdf_c++.a and
libnetcdf_c++.la will be added. If separate fortran libraries are
built, libnetcdff.a and libnetcdff.la will also be added.

     <p>Static library users should ignore the .la files, and link to the .a
files.

     <p>Shared library builds will add some .so files to this directory, as
well.

     <br><dt><code>include</code><dd>Header files will be installed here. The C library header file is
netcdf.h. If the C++ library is built, ntcdfcpp.h, ncvalues.h and
netcdf.hh will be installed here. If the F77 API is built, netcdf.inc
will be copied here. If the F90 API is built, the netcdf.mod and
typesizes.mod files will be copied here as well.

     <br><dt><code>bin</code><dd>Utilities ncdump and ncgen will be installed here.

     <br><dt><code>man</code><dd>The ncdump/ncgen man pages will be installed in subdirectory man1, and
the three man pages netcdf.3, netcdf_f77.3, and netcdf_f90.3 will be
installed in the man3 subdirectory.

     <br><dt><code>share</code><dd>If the configure is called with the &ndash;enable-install-docs option, the
netCDF documentation set will be built, and will be installed under
the share directory, under the netcdf subdirectory. This will include
postscript, PDF, info and text versions of all netCDF manuals. These
manuals are also available at the netCDF web site.

The following platform-specific note may be helpful when building and
installing netCDF. Consult your vendor manuals for information about
the options listed here. Compilers can change from version to version;
the following information may not apply to your platform.

   <p>Full output from some of the platforms of the test platforms for
netCDF 3.6.2 can be found at <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/builds">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/builds</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.1 AIX</h4>

<p>We found the vendor compilers in /usr/vac/bin, and included this
in our PATH. Compilers were xlc, xlf, xlf90, xlC.

   <p>The F90 compiler requires the qsuffix option to believe that F90 code
files can end with .f90. This is automatically turned on by configure
when needed (we hope):
<pre class="example">         F90FLAGS=-qsuffix=f=f90
</pre>
   <p>We had to use xlf for F77 code, and xlf90 for F90 code.

   <p>To compile 64-bit code, use the &ndash;enable-64bit option when running
configure, and it will set the appropriate environment variables for
you (documented below).

   <p>The environment variable OBJECT_MODE can be set to 64, or use the -q64
option on all AIX compilers by setting CFLAGS, FFLAGS, and CXXFLAGS to
-q64.

   <p>The following is also necessary on an IBM AIX SP system for 64-bit
mode:

<pre class="example">         ARFLAGS='-X64 cru'
         NMFLAGS='-X64'
</pre>
   <p>There are thread-safe versions of the AIX compilers. For example,
xlc_r is the thread-safe C compiler. The NetCDF configure script
ignores these compilers. To use thread-safe compilers, override the
configure script by setting CC to xlc_r; similarly for FC and CXX.

   <p>For large file support, AIX requires that the macro _LARGE_FILES be
defined. The configure script does this using
AC_SYS_LARGEFILES. Unfortunately, this misfires when OBJECT_MODE is
64, or the q64 option is used. The netCDF tries to fix this by turning
on _LARGE_FILES anyway in these cases.

   <p>The GNU C compiler does not mix successfully with the AIX fortran
compilers.

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.2 Cygwin</h4>

<p>Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows. NetCDF builds under
Cygwin tools on Windows just as with Linux. For more information see
the Cygwin web site: <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>.

   <p>Building under Cygwin will yield a DLL on windows (as long as
&ndash;enable-shared is used with configure). However this DLL will not
work without the Cygwin POSIX emulation DLL as well. For a stand-alone
DLL, use MinGW (below).

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.3 MinGW</h4>

<p>MinGW, or Minimalist GNU for Windows, is a set of GNU Unix tools
ported to Windows. The NetCDF C and Fortran APIs builds under MinGW
tools on Windows just as with Linux.

   <p>Those diving into netCDF and MinGW should be familiar with the
information at the web page &ldquo;Different Ways of Building Woe32 DLLs&rdquo;
at: <a href="http://www.haible.de/bruno/woe32dll.html">http://www.haible.de/bruno/woe32dll.html</a>, the MinGW FAQ at:
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml">http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml</a>, and the peculiarities of the win32
environment as explained by this helpful Red Hat document at:
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/gnu-linker/win32.html">http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/gnu-linker/win32.html</a>.

   <p>The netCDF C++ API does not (yet) build DLLs cleanly under MinGW. Any
knowledgeable user who can make this work should send results to the
netCDF support email address: support@unidata.ucar.edu.

   <p>Using MinGW it is possible to produce stand-alone windows DLLs. First
build netCDF in the usual way, with &ndash;enable-shared and &ndash;enable-dll
as configure options.

   <p>This builds the DLL for compatibility with g77. Set FC to the command
line invocation of your fortran compiler. To build for other fortran
compilers (i.e. ones you don't have), change the config.h file to
select another fortran and recompile (without rerunning configure).

   <p>The fortran tests will not, of course, work for these other fortrans,
because you don't have the compiler to compile the test program!

<pre class="example">     FC=g77 ./configure --enable-dll --disable-cxx --enable-shared
     make check
</pre>
   <p>Due to the magic of libtool, the output files are found in the
libsrc/.libs directory.

   <p>To get a MS compatible export library, open an MS DOS window, change
directory to libsrc/.libs and run the following command:

<pre class="example">     lib /machine:i386 /def:libnetcdf.def
</pre>
   <p>The above command uses the Microsoft LIB tool, which comes with Visual
C++.NET, and perhaps other Microsoft development tools. (To get this in
my path, I open the &ldquo;Visual Studio 2003 Command Prompt&rdquo; in my
Windows program menu.)

   <p>This command creates the .lib file, the import library, needed (or at
least used) by MicroSoft (and other) build environments on Windows.

   <p>For more information about MinGW, see the MinGW web site:
<a href="http://www.mingw.org">http://www.mingw.org</a>. For more information about producing
stand-alone windows DLLs with MinGW, see the MinGW FAQ:
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml">http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.4 HPUX</h4>

<p>For the c89 compiler to work, CPPFLAGS must include
-D_HPUX_SOURCE. This isn't required for the cc compiler.

   <p>Our HPUX machine has two C compilers. Only the one in /opt/ansic/bin/
works for netCDF.

   <p>For large file support, HP-UX requires _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64. The
configure script sets this automatically.

   <p>The HPUX C++ compiler (on our machine) doesn't work on netCDF
code. It's too old for that. So either use GNU to compile netCDF, or
skip the C++ code by setting CXX to &rdquo; (in csh: setenv CXX &rdquo;), or
using the &ndash;disable-cxx option.

   <p>Building a 64 bit version may be possible with the following settings:
<pre class="example">         CC=/bin/cc
         CPPFLAGS='-D_HPUX_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64'    # large file support
         CFLAGS='-g +DD64'                           # 64-bit mode
         FC=/opt/fortran90/bin/f90                   # Fortran-90 compiler
         FFLAGS='-w +noppu +DA2.0W'                  # 64-bit mode, no "_" suffixes
         FLIBS=-lU77
         CXX=''                                      # no 64-bit mode C++ compiler
</pre>
   <p>Sometimes quotas or configuration causes HPUX disks to be limited to 2
GiB files. In this cases, netCDF cannot create very large
files. Rather confusingly, HPUX returns a system error that indicates
that a value is too large to be stored in a type. This may cause
scientists to earnestly check for attempts to write floats or doubles
that are too large. In fact, the problem seems to be an internal
integer problem, when the netCDF library attempts to read beyond the 2
GiB boundary. To add to the confusion, the boundary for netCDF is
slightly less than 2 GiB, since netCDF uses buffered I/O to improve
performance.

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.5 Irix</h4>

<p>A 64-bit version can be built with the &ndash;enable-64bit option when
running configure; it will set the appropriate environment variables
for you.

   <p>It builds 64-bit by setting CFLAGS, FFLAGS, and CXXFLAGS to -64.

   <p>On our machine, there is a /bin/cc and a /usr/bin/cc, and the -64
option only works with the former.

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.6 Linux</h4>

<p>The f2cFortran flag is required with GNU fortran:
<pre class="example">         CPPFLAGS=-Df2cFortran
</pre>
   <p>For Portland Group Fortran, set pgiFortran instead:
<pre class="example">         CPPFLAGS=-DpgiFortran
</pre>
   <p>Portland Group F90/F95 does not mix with GNU g77.

   <p>The netCDF configure script should notice which fortran compiler is
being used, and set these automatically.

   <p>For large file support, _FILE_OFFSET_BITS must be set to 64. The
netCDF configure script should set this automatically.

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.7 Macintosh</h4>

<p>The f2cFortran flag is required with GNU fortran
(CPPFLAGS=-Df2cFortran). The NetCDF configure script should and set
this automatically.

   <p>For IBM compilers on the Mac, the following may work (we lack this
test environment):
<pre class="example">         CC=/usr/bin/cc
         CPPFLAGS=-DIBMR2Fortran
         FC=xlf
         F90=xlf90
         F90FLAGS=-qsuffix=cpp=f90
</pre>
   <p>For the g95 compiler, you must set LIBS to -lSystemStubs before
running configure.

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.8 OSF1</h4>

<p>NetCDF builds out of the box on OSF1.

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.9 SunOS</h4>

<p>PATH should contain /usr/ccs/bin to find make, nm, ar, etc.

   <p>For large file support, _FILE_OFFSET_BITS must be 64. Configure will
turn this on automatically.

   <p>Large file support doesn't work with c89, unless the -Xa option is
used. The netCDF configure script turns this on automatically where
appropriate.

   <p>To compile in 64-bit mode, use option &ndash;enable-64bit with
configure. It sets -xarch=v9 on all compilers (i.e. in CFLAGS, FFLAGS,
and CXXFLAGS).

   <p>When compiling with GNU Fortran (g77), the -Df2cFortran flag is
required for the Fortran interface to work. The NetCDF configure
script turns this on automatically if needed.

<h4 class="subsection">3.8.10 Handling Fortran Compilers</h4>

<p>The first thing to try is to set nothing and see if the netCDF
configure script finds your fortran compiler, and sets the correct
flags automatically.

   <p>If it doesn't find the correct fortran compiler, you can next try
setting the FC environment variable to the compiler you wish to use,
and then see if the configure script can set the correct flags for
that compiler.

   <p>If all that fails, you must set the flags yourself.

<h5 class="subsubsection">3.8.10.1 Intel Fortran</h5>

<p>The Intel compiler requires that netCDF be built with the pgiFortran
flag. It will be automatically turned on by configure if your fortran
compiler is named &ldquo;ifort.&rdquo;

<h5 class="subsubsection">3.8.10.2 Portland Group Fortran</h5>

<p>The Portland Group fortran compiler requires that netCDF be built with
the pgiFortran flag. It will be automatically turned on by configure
if your fortran compiler is named &ldquo;pgf90.&rdquo;

<h5 class="subsubsection">3.8.10.3 GNU Fortran</h5>

<p>The GNU Fortran 77 compiler (g77) requires that netCDF be built with
the f2cFortran flag. This is turned on automatically by
configure. Since g77 can't build Fortran 90 code, the F90 API will not
be built if g77 is the only available fortran compiler.

   <p>The version 4 series of gcc, the GNU Compiler Collection, offers a F95
compiler, usually called gfortran. NetCDF requires the pgiFortran flag
to build with gfortran, and this is turned on automatically by
configure.

<h5 class="subsubsection">3.8.10.4 g95</h5>

<p>g95 is a Fortran 95 compiler which is different from the Free Software
Foundation's gfortran. The netCDF configure script sets the f2cFortran
flag when g95 is used.

   <p>Some g95 users recommend instead setting the following, which handles
the underscores differently, and reportedly works better when
integrating with other packages or libraries:

<pre class="example">     CC=gcc
     FC=g95
     CPPFLAGS=-DpgiFortran
     FFLAGS=-fno-second-underscore
     FCFLAGS=-fno-second-underscore
</pre>
   <p>If this approach is taken, all fortran programs which use netCDF must
be compiled with the -fno-second-underscore flag.

   <p>One the Macintosh, g95 requires environment variables LIBS and FLIBS
to be set to -lSystemStubs.

<h5 class="subsubsection">3.8.10.5 g++</h5>

<p>Older versions of the GNU C++ compiler don't handle large files
well. A version 3.2 installation of g++ fails to build for me without
&ndash;disable-largefile. This turns off the ability of netCDF to handle
files larger than about 2 GiBytes. Users should upgrade their g++, or
learn to live with small files.

The configure and build system should work on any system which has a
modern "sh" shell, "make", and so on. The configure and build system
is less portable than the "C" code itself, however. You may run into
problems with the "include" syntax in the Makefiles. You can use GNU
make to overcome this, or simply manually include the specified files
after running configure.

   <p>Instruction for building netCDF on other platforms can be found at
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/other-builds.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/other-builds.html</a>. If you build netCDF on a new
platform, please send your environment variables and any other
important notes to support@unidata.ucar.edu and we will add the
information to the other builds page, with a credit to you.

   <p>If you can't run the configure script, you will need to create
config.h and fortran/nfconfig.inc. Start with ncconfig.in and
fortran/nfconfig.in and set the defines as appropriate for your
system.

   <p>Operating system dependency is isolated in the "ncio" module. We
provide two versions. posixio.c uses POSIX system calls like "open()",
"read()" and "write().  ffio.c uses a special library available on
CRAY systems. You could create other versions for different operating
systems. The program "t_ncio.c" can be used as a simple test of this
layer.

   <p>Note that we have not had a Cray to test on for some time. In
particular, large file support is not tested with ffio.c.

   <p>Numerical representation dependency is isolated in the "ncx"
module. As supplied, ncx.m4 (ncx.c) supports IEEE floating point
representation, VAX floating point, and CRAY floating
point. BIG_ENDIAN vs LITTLE_ENDIAN is handled, as well as various
sizes of "int", "short", and "long". We assume, however, that a "char"
is eight bits.

   <p>There is a separate implementation of the ncx interface available as
ncx_cray.c which contains optimizations for CRAY vector
architectures. Move the generic ncx.c out of the way and rename
ncx_cray.c to ncx.c to use this module. By default, this module does
not use the IEG2CRAY and CRAY2IEG library calls. When compiled with
aggressive in-lining and optimization, it provides equivalent
functionality with comparable speed and clearer error semantics. If
you wish to use the IEG library functions, compile this module with
-DUSE_IEG.

<h3 class="section">3.10 Contributing to NetCDF Source Code Development</h3>

<p>Most users will not be interested in working directly with the netCDF
source code. Rather, they will write programs which call netCDF
functions, and delve no further. However some intrepid users may wish
to dig into the netCDF code to study it, to try and spot bugs, or to
make modifications for their own purposes.

   <p>To work with the netCDF source code, several extra utilities are
required to fully build everything from source. If you are going to
modify the netCDF source code, you will need some or all of the
following Unix tools.

     <dl>
<dt><code>m4</code><a name="index-m4-82"></a><dd>Macro processing language used heavily in libsrc, nc_test. Generates
(in these cases) C code from m4 source. Version 1.4 works fine with
release 3.5.1 through 3.6.2.

     <br><dt><code>flex and yacc</code><a name="index-flex-and-yacc-83"></a><dd>Used in ncgen directory to parse CDL files. Generates C files from .y
and .l files. You only need to use this to modify ncgen's understanding of
CDL grammar.

     <br><dt><code>makeinfo</code><a name="index-makeinfo-84"></a><dd>Generates all documentation formats (except man pages) from texinfo
source. I'm using makeinfo version 4.8, as of release 3.6.2. If you
have trouble with makeinfo, upgrade to this version and try again. You
only need makeinfo if you want to modify the documentation.

     <br><dt><code>tex</code><a name="index-tex-85"></a><dd>Knuth's venerable typesetting system. The version I am running (for
netCDF release 3.6.2) is TeX 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4). I have found that
some recent installations of TeX will not build the netCDF
documentation - it's not clear to me why.

     <p>The user generally will just want to download the latest version of
netCDF documents at the netCDF website. <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs</a>.

     <br><dt><code>autoconf</code><a name="index-autoconf-86"></a><dd>Generates the configure script. Version 2.59 or later is required.

     <br><dt><code>automake</code><a name="index-automake-87"></a><dd>Since version 3.6.2 of netCDF, automake is used to generate the
Makefile.in files needed by the configure script to build the
Makefiles.

     <br><dt><code>libtool</code><a name="index-libtool-88"></a><dd>Since version 3.6.2 of netCDF, libtool is used to help generate shared
libraries platforms which support them. Version 2.1a of libtool is
required.

     <br><dt><code>sed</code><a name="index-sed-89"></a><dd>This text processing tool is used to process some of the netCDF
examples before they are included in the tutorial. This is only needed
to build the documentation, which the user generally will not need to
do.

   </dl>

   <p>NetCDF has a large and enterprising user community, and a long history
of accepting user modifications into the netCDF code base. Examples
include the 64-bit offset format, and the F90 API.

   <p>All suggested changes and additions to netCDF code can be sent to
support@unidata.ucar.edu.

<p><a name="index-windows_002c-building-on-90"></a><a name="index-VC_002b_002b-91"></a><a name="index-NET-92"></a><a name="index-DLL-93"></a><a name="index-Microsoft-94"></a>
NetCDF can be built and used from a variety of development
environments on Windows. The netCDF library is implemented as a
Windows dynamic link library (DLL). The simplest way to get started
with netCDF under Windows is to download the pre-built DLL from the
Unidata web site.

   <p>Building under the Cygwin port of GNU tools is treated as a Unix
install. See <a href="#Platform-Specific-Notes">Platform Specific Notes</a>.

   <p>Instructions are also given for building the netCDF DLL from the
source code using Microsoft's Visual Studio and VC++.NET.

   <p>VC++ documentation being so voluminous, finding the right information
can be a chore. There's a good discussion of using DLLs called &ldquo;About
Dynamic-Link Libraries&rdquo; at (perhaps)
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/dynamic_link_libraries.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/dynamic_link_libraries.asp</a>.

   <p>From the .NET point of view, the netCDF dll is unmanaged code. As a
starting point, see the help topic &ldquo;Consuming Unmanaged DLL
Functions&rdquo; which may be found at
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconConsumingUnmanagedDLLFunctions.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconConsumingUnmanagedDLLFunctions.asp</a>,

We have pre-built Win32 binary versions of the netcdf dll and static
library, as well as ncgen.exe and ncdump.exe (dll and static

Whether you get the pre-built DLL or build your own, you'll then have
to install it somewhere so that your other programs can find it and
use it.

   <p>To install a DLL, you just have to leave it in some directory, and
(possibly) tell your compiler in which directory to look for it.

   <p>A DLL is a library, and functions just like libraries under the Unix
operating system. As with any library, the point of the netCDF DLL is
to provide functions that you can call from your own code. When you
compile that code, the linker needs to be able to find the library,
and then it pulls out the functions that it needs. In the Unix world,
the -L option tells the compiler where to look for a library. In
Windows, library search directories can be added to the project's
property dialog.

   <p>Similarly, you will need to put the header file, netcdf.h, somewhere
that you compiler can find it. In the Unix world, the -I option tells
the compiler to look in a certain directory to find header files. In
the Windows world, you set this in the project properties dialog box
of your integrated development environment.

   <p>Therefore, installing the library means nothing more than copying the
DLL somewhere that your compiler can find it, and telling the compiler
where to look for them.

   <p>The standard place to put DLLs is Windows\System32 folder (for
Windows2000/XP) or the Windows\System folder (for Windows 98/ME). If
you put the DLL there, along with the ncgen and ncdump executables,
you will be able to use the DLL and utilities without further work,
because compilers already look there for DLLs and EXEs.

   <p>Instead of putting the DLL and EXEs into the system directory, you can
leave them wherever you want, and every development project that uses
the dll will have to be told to search the netCDF directory when it's
linking, or, the chosen directory can be added to your path.

   <p>On the .NET platform, you can also try to use the global assembly
cache. (To learn how, see MSDN topic &ldquo;Global Assembly Cache&rdquo;, at
<a href="www.msdn.microsoft.com">www.msdn.microsoft.com</a>).

   <p>Following Windows conventions, the netCDF files belong in the

To build the netCDF dll with VC++.NET open the win32/NET/netcdf.sln
file with Visual Studio. Both Debug and Release configurations are
available - select one and build.

   <p>The resulting netcdf.dll file will be in subdirectory Release or
Debug.

   <p>The netCDF tests will be built and run as part of the build
process. The Fortran 77 interface will be built, but not the Fortran
90 or C++ interfaces.

   <p>The quick_large_files test program is provided as an extra project,
however it is not run during the build process, but can be run from
the command line or the IDE. Note that, despite its name, it is not
quick. On Unix systems, this program runs in a few seconds, because of
some features of the Unix file system apparently not present in
Windows. Nonetheless, the program does run, and creates (then deletes)
some very large files. (So make sure you have at least 15 GiB of space
available). It takes about 45 minutes to run this program on our
Windows machines, so please be patient.

Load-time linking to the DLL is the most straightforward from
C++. This means the netcdf.lib file has to end up on the compile
command line. This being Windows, that's hidden by a GUI.

   <p>In Visual Studio 2003 this can be done by modifying three of the
project's properties.

   <p>Open the project properties window from the project menu. Go to the
linker folder and look at the general properties. Modify the property
&ldquo;Additional Library Directories&rdquo; by adding the directory which
contains the netcdf.dll and netcdf.lib files.  Now go to the linker
input properties and set the property &ldquo;Additional Dependencies&rdquo; to
netcdf.lib.

   <p>Finally, still within the project properties window, go to the C/C++
folder, and look at the general properties. Modify &ldquo;Additional
Include Directories&rdquo; to add the directory with the netcdf.h file.

   <p>Now use the netCDF functions in your C++ code. Of course any C or C++
file that wants to use the functions will need:

<h3 class="section">5.1 The Usual Build Problems</h3>

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.1 Taking the Easy Way Out</h4>

<p>Why not take the easy way out if you can?

   <p>Pre-compiled binaries for many platforms can be found at
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/binaries.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/binaries.html</a>. Click on your platform, and copy
the files from the bin, include, lib, and man directories into your
own local equivalents (Perhaps /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/include,
etc.).

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.2 How to Clean Up the Mess from a Failed Build</h4>

<p>If you are trying to get the configure or build to work, make sure you
start with a clean distribution for each attempt. If netCDF failed in
the &ldquo;make&rdquo; you must clean up the mess before trying again. To clean
up the distribution:

<pre class="example">     make distclean
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">5.1.3 Platforms On Which NetCDF is Known to Work</h4>

<p>At NetCDF World Headquarters (in sunny Boulder, Colorado), as part of
the wonderful Unidata organization, we have a wide variety of
computers, operating systems, and compilers. At night, house elves
test netCDF on all these systems.

   <p>Output for the netCDF test platforms can be found at
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/builds">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/builds</a>.

   <p>Compare the output of your build attempt with ours. Are you using the
same compiler? The same flags? Look for the configure output that
lists the settings of CC, FC, CXX, CFLAGS, etc.

   <p>On some systems you have to set environment variables to get the
configure and build to work.

   <p>For example, for a 64-bit IRIX install of the netCDF-3.6.2 release,
the variables are set before netCDF is configured or built. In this
case we set CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and FFLAGS. (This can also be
accomplished automatically by using &ndash;enable-64bit with configure.)

<pre class="example">     flip% uname -a
     IRIX64 flip 6.5 07080050 IP30 mips
     flip% setenv CFLAGS -64
     flip% setenv CXXFLAGS -64
     flip% setenv FFLAGS -64
     flip% make distclean;./configure;make check
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">5.1.4 Platforms On Which NetCDF is Reported to Work</h4>

<p>If your platform isn't listed on the successful build page, see if
another friendly netCDF user has sent in values for environment
variables that are reported to work:
(<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/other-builds.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/other-builds.html</a>).

   <p>If you build on a system that we don't have at Unidata (particularly
if it's something interesting and exotic), please send us the settings
that work (and the entire build output would be nice too). Send them
to support@unidata.ucar.edu.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.5 If You Have a Broken Compiler</h4>

<p>For netCDF to build correctly, you must be able to compile C from your
environment, and, optionally, Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and C++. If
C doesn't work, netCDF can't compile.

   <p>What breaks a C compiler? Installation or upgrade mistakes when the C
compiler was installed, or multiple versions or compilers installed on
top of each other. Commercial compilers frequently require some
environment variables to be set, and some directories to appear ahead
of others in your path. Finally, if you have an expired or broken
license, your C complier won't work.

   <p>If you have a broken C compiler and a working C compiler in your PATH,
netCDF might only find the broken one. You can fix this by explicitly
setting the CC environmental variable to a working C compiler, and
then trying to build netCDF again. (Don't forget to do a &ldquo;make
distclean&rdquo; first!)

   <p>If you can't build a C program, you can't build netCDF. Sorry, but
that's just the way it goes. (You can get the GNU C compiler - search
the web for &ldquo;gcc&rdquo;).

   <p>If netCDF finds a broken Fortran 90, Fortran 77, or C++ compiler, it
will report the problem during the configure, and then drop the
associated API. For example, if the C++ compiler can't compile a very
simple test program, it will drop the C++ interface. If you really
want the C++ API, set the CXX environment variable to a working C++
compiler.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.6 What to Do If NetCDF Still Won't Build</h4>

<p>If none of the above help, try our troubleshooting section:
See <a href="#Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>.

   <p>Also check to see of your problem has already been solved by someone
else (see <a href="#Finding-Help">Finding Help</a>).

   <p>If you still can't get netCDF to build, report your problem to
Unidata, but please make sure you submit all the information we need
to help (see <a href="#Reporting-Problems">Reporting Problems</a>).

<h3 class="section">5.2 Troubleshooting</h3>

<p><a name="index-troubleshooting-112"></a><a name="index-turning-off-C_002b_002b_002c-Fortran-interface-113"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.1 Problems During Configuration</h4>

<p>If the ./configure; make check fails, it's a good idea to turn off the
C++ and Fortran interfaces, and try to build the C interface
alone. All other interfaces depend on the C interface, so nothing else
will work until the C interface works. To turn off C++ and Fortran,
set environment variables CXX and FC to NULL before running the netCDF
configure script (with csh: setenv FC &rdquo;;setenv CXX &rdquo;).

   <p>Turning off the Fortran and C++ interfaces results in a much shorter
build and test cycle, which is useful for debugging problems.

   <p>If the netCDF configure fails, most likely the problem is with your
development environment. The configure script looks through your path to
find all the tools it needs to build netCDF, including C compiler and
linker, the ar, ranlib, and others. The configure script will tell
you what tools it found, and where they are on your system. Here's
part of configure's output on a Linux machine:

<pre class="example">     checking CPPFLAGS...  -Df2cFortran
     checking CC CFLAGS... cc -g
     checking which cc... /usr/bin/cc
     checking CXX... c++
     checking CXXFLAGS... -g -O2
     checking which c++... /usr/local/bin/c++
     checking FC... f77
     checking FFLAGS...
     checking which f77... /usr/bin/f77
     checking F90... unset
     checking AR... ar
     checking ARFLAGS... cru
     checking which ar... /usr/bin/ar
     checking NM... nm
     checking NMFLAGS...
     checking which nm... /usr/bin/nm
</pre>
   <p>Make sure that the tools, directories, and flags are set to reasonable
values, and compatible tools. For example the GNU tools may not
inter-operate well with vendor tools. If you're using a vendor
compiler, use the ar, nm, and ranlib that the vendor supplied.

   <p>As configure runs, it creates a config.log file. If configure crashes,
do a text search of config.log for thing it was checking before
crashing. If you have a licensing or tool compatibility problem, it
will be obvious in config.log.

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.2 Problems During Compilation</h4>

<p>If the configure script runs, but the compile step doesn't work, or
the tests don't complete successfully, the problem is probably in your
CFLAGS or CPPFLAGS.

   <p>Frequently shared libraries are a rich source of problems. If your
build is not working, and you are using the &ndash;enable-shared option to
generate shared libraries, then try to build without &ndash;enable-shared,
and see if the static library build works.

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.3 Problems During Testing</h4>

<p>If you are planning on using large files (i.e. &gt; 2 GiB), then you may
wish to rerun configure with &ndash;enable-large-file-tests to ensure that
large files work on your system.
