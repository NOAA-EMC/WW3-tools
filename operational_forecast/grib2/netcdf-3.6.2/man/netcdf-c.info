1 Use of the NetCDF Library
***************************

You can use the netCDF library without knowing about all of the netCDF
interface. If you are creating a netCDF dataset, only a handful of
routines are required to define the necessary dimensions, variables,
and attributes, and to write the data to the netCDF dataset. (Even less
are needed if you use the ncgen utility to create the dataset before
running a program using netCDF library calls to write data.)
Similarly, if you are writing software to access data stored in a
particular netCDF object, only a small subset of the netCDF library is
required to open the netCDF dataset and access the data. Authors of
generic applications that access arbitrary netCDF datasets need to be
familiar with more of the netCDF library.

   In this chapter we provide templates of common sequences of netCDF
calls needed for common uses. For clarity we present only the names of
routines; omit declarations and error checking; omit the type-specific
suffixes of routine names for variables and attributes; indent
statements that are typically invoked multiple times; and use ... to
represent arbitrary sequences of other statements. Full parameter lists
are described in later chapters.

1.1 Creating a NetCDF Dataset
=============================

Here is a typical sequence of netCDF calls used to create a new netCDF
dataset:

         nc_create           /* create netCDF dataset: enter define mode */
              ...
            nc_def_dim       /* define dimensions: from name and length */
              ...
            nc_def_var       /* define variables: from name, type, ... */
              ...
            nc_put_att       /* put attribute: assign attribute values */
              ...
         nc_enddef           /* end definitions: leave define mode */
              ...
            nc_put_var       /* provide values for variables */
              ...
         nc_close            /* close: save new netCDF dataset */

   Only one call is needed to create a netCDF dataset, at which point
you will be in the first of two netCDF modes. When accessing an open
netCDF dataset, it is either in define mode or data mode. In define
mode, you can create dimensions, variables, and new attributes, but you
cannot read or write variable data. In data mode, you can access data
and change existing attributes, but you are not permitted to create new
dimensions, variables, or attributes.

   One call to nc_def_dim is needed for each dimension created.
Similarly, one call to nc_def_var is needed for each variable creation,
and one call to a member of the nc_put_att family is needed for each
attribute defined and assigned a value. To leave define mode and enter
data mode, call nc_enddef.

   Once in data mode, you can add new data to variables, change old
values, and change values of existing attributes (so long as the
attribute changes do not require more storage space). Single values may
be written to a netCDF variable with one of the members of the
nc_put_var1 family, depending on what type of data you have to write.
All the values of a variable may be written at once with one of the
members of the nc_put_var family. Arrays or array cross-sections of a
variable may be written using members of the nc_put_vara family.
Subsampled array sections may be written using members of the
nc_put_vars family. Mapped array sections may be written using members
of the nc_put_varm family. (Subsampled and mapped access are general
forms of data access that are explained later.)

   Finally, you should explicitly close all netCDF datasets that have
been opened for writing by calling nc_close. By default, access to the
file system is buffered by the netCDF library. If a program terminates
abnormally with netCDF datasets open for writing, your most recent
modifications may be lost. This default buffering of data is disabled
by setting the NC_SHARE flag when opening the dataset. But even if this
flag is set, changes to attribute values or changes made in define mode
are not written out until nc_sync or nc_close is called.

1.2 Reading a NetCDF Dataset with Known Names
=============================================

Here we consider the case where you know the names of not only the
netCDF datasets, but also the names of their dimensions, variables, and
attributes. (Otherwise you would have to do "inquire" calls.) The order
of typical C calls to read data from those variables in a netCDF
dataset is:

         nc_open                /* open existing netCDF dataset */
              ...
            nc_inq_dimid        /* get dimension IDs */
              ...
            nc_inq_varid        /* get variable IDs */
              ...
            nc_get_att          /* get attribute values */
              ...
            nc_get_var          /* get values of variables */
              ...
         nc_close               /* close netCDF dataset */

   First, a single call opens the netCDF dataset, given the dataset
name, and returns a netCDF ID that is used to refer to the open netCDF
dataset in all subsequent calls.

   Next, a call to nc_inq_dimid for each dimension of interest gets the
dimension ID from the dimension name. Similarly, each required variable
ID is determined from its name by a call to nc_inq_varid Once variable
IDs are known, variable attribute values can be retrieved using the
netCDF ID, the variable ID, and the desired attribute name as input to
a member of the nc_get_att family (typically nc_get_att_text or
nc_get_att_double) for each desired attribute. Variable data values can
be directly accessed from the netCDF dataset with calls to members of
the nc_get_var1 family for single values, the nc_get_var family for
entire variables, or various other members of the nc_get_vara,
nc_get_vars, or nc_get_varm families for array, subsampled or mapped
access.

   Finally, the netCDF dataset is closed with nc_close. There is no need
to close a dataset open only for reading.

1.3 Reading a netCDF Dataset with Unknown Names
===============================================

It is possible to write programs (e.g., generic software) which do such
things as processing every variable, without needing to know in advance
the names of these variables. Similarly, the names of dimensions and
attributes may be unknown.

   Names and other information about netCDF objects may be obtained from
netCDF datasets by calling inquire functions. These return information
about a whole netCDF dataset, a dimension, a variable, or an attribute.
The following template illustrates how they are used:

         nc_open                   /* open existing netCDF dataset */
           ...
         nc_inq                    /* find out what is in it */
              ...
            nc_inq_dim             /* get dimension names, lengths */
              ...
            nc_inq_var             /* get variable names, types, shapes */
                 ...
               nc_inq_attname      /* get attribute names */
                 ...
               nc_inq_att          /* get attribute types and lengths */
                 ...
               nc_get_att          /* get attribute values */
                 ...
            nc_get_var             /* get values of variables */
              ...
         nc_close                  /* close netCDF dataset */

   As in the previous example, a single call opens the existing netCDF
dataset, returning a netCDF ID. This netCDF ID is given to the nc_inq
routine, which returns the number of dimensions, the number of
variables, the number of global attributes, and the ID of the unlimited
dimension, if there is one.

   All the inquire functions are inexpensive to use and require no I/O,
since the information they provide is stored in memory when a netCDF
dataset is first opened.

   Dimension IDs use consecutive integers, beginning at 0. Also
dimensions, once created, cannot be deleted. Therefore, knowing the
number of dimension IDs in a netCDF dataset means knowing all the
dimension IDs: they are the integers 0, 1, 2, ...up to the number of
dimensions. For each dimension ID, a call to the inquire function
nc_inq_dim returns the dimension name and length.

   Variable IDs are also assigned from consecutive integers 0, 1, 2,
... up to the number of variables. These can be used in nc_inq_var
calls to find out the names, types, shapes, and the number of
attributes assigned to each variable.

   Once the number of attributes for a variable is known, successive
calls to nc_inq_attname return the name for each attribute given the
netCDF ID, variable ID, and attribute number. Armed with the attribute
name, a call to nc_inq_att returns its type and length. Given the type
and length, you can allocate enough space to hold the attribute values.
Then a call to a member of the nc_get_att family returns the attribute
values.

   Once the IDs and shapes of netCDF variables are known, data values
can be accessed by calling a member of the nc_get_var1 family for single
values, or members of the nc_get_var, nc_get_vara, nc_get_vars, or
nc_get_varm for various kinds of array access.

1.4 Adding New Dimensions, Variables, Attributes
================================================

An existing netCDF dataset can be extensively altered. New dimensions,
variables, and attributes can be added or existing ones renamed, and
existing attributes can be deleted. Existing dimensions, variables, and
attributes can be renamed. The following code template lists a typical
sequence of calls to add new netCDF components to an existing dataset:

         nc_open             /* open existing netCDF dataset */
           ...
         nc_redef            /* put it into define mode */
             ...
           nc_def_dim        /* define additional dimensions (if any) */
             ...
           nc_def_var        /* define additional variables (if any) */
             ...
           nc_put_att        /* define additional attributes (if any) */
             ...
         nc_enddef           /* check definitions, leave define mode */
             ...
           nc_put_var        /* provide values for new variables */
             ...
         nc_close            /* close netCDF dataset */

   A netCDF dataset is first opened by the nc_open call. This call puts
the open dataset in data mode, which means existing data values can be
accessed and changed, existing attributes can be changed (so long as
they do not grow), but nothing can be added. To add new netCDF
dimensions, variables, or attributes you must enter define mode, by
calling nc_redef. In define mode, call nc_def_dim to define new
dimensions, nc_def_var to define new variables, and a member of the
nc_put_attfamily to assign new attributes to variables or enlarge old
attributes.

   You can leave define mode and reenter data mode, checking all the new
definitions for consistency and committing the changes to disk, by
calling nc_enddef. If you do not wish to reenter data mode, just call
nc_close, which will have the effect of first calling nc_enddef.

   Until the nc_enddef call, you may back out of all the redefinitions
made in define mode and restore the previous state of the netCDF
dataset by calling nc_abort. You may also use the nc_abort call to
restore the netCDF dataset to a consistent state if the call to
nc_enddef fails. If you have called nc_close from definition mode and
the implied call to nc_enddef fails, nc_abort will automatically be
called to close the netCDF dataset and leave it in its previous
consistent state (before you entered define mode).

   At most one process should have a netCDF dataset open for writing at
one time. The library is designed to provide limited support for
multiple concurrent readers with one writer, via disciplined use of the
nc_sync function and the NC_SHARE flag. If a writer makes changes in
define mode, such as the addition of new variables, dimensions, or
attributes, some means external to the library is necessary to prevent
readers from making concurrent accesses and to inform readers to call
nc_sync before the next access.

1.5 Error Handling
==================

The netCDF library provides the facilities needed to handle errors in a
flexible way. Each netCDF function returns an integer status value. If
the returned status value indicates an error, you may handle it in any
way desired, from printing an associated error message and exiting to
ignoring the error indication and proceeding (not recommended!). For
simplicity, the examples in this guide check the error status and call
a separate function, handle_err(), to handle any errors. One possible
definition of handle_err() can be found withdin the documentation of
nc_strerror (*note nc_strerror::).

   The nc_strerror function is available to convert a returned integer
error status into an error message string.

   Occasionally, low-level I/O errors may occur in a layer below the
netCDF library. For example, if a write operation causes you to exceed
disk quotas or to attempt to write to a device that is no longer
available, you may get an error from a layer below the netCDF library,
but the resulting write error will still be reflected in the returned
status value.

1.6 Compiling and Linking with the NetCDF Library
=================================================

Details of how to compile and link a program that uses the netCDF C or
FORTRAN interfaces differ, depending on the operating system, the
available compilers, and where the netCDF library and include files are
installed. Nevertheless, we provide here examples of how to compile and
link a program that uses the netCDF library on a Unix platform, so that
you can adjust these examples to fit your installation.

   Every C file that references netCDF functions or constants must
contain an appropriate #include statement before the first such
reference:

     #include <netcdf.h>

   Unless the netcdf.h file is installed in a standard directory where
the C compiler always looks, you must use the -I option when invoking
the compiler, to specify a directory where netcdf.h is installed, for
example:

     cc -c -I/usr/local/netcdf/include myprogram.c

   Alternatively, you could specify an absolute path name in the
#include statement, but then your program would not compile on another
platform where netCDF is installed in a different location.

   Unless the netCDF library is installed in a standard directory where
the linker always looks, you must use the -L and -l options to link an
object file that uses the netCDF library. For example:

     cc -o myprogram myprogram.o -L/usr/local/netcdf/lib -lnetcdf

   Alternatively, you could specify an absolute path name for the
library:

     cc -o myprogram myprogram.o -l/usr/local/netcdf/lib/libnetcdf.a

2 Datasets
**********

This chapter presents the interfaces of the netCDF functions that deal
with a netCDF dataset or the whole netCDF library.

   A netCDF dataset that has not yet been opened can only be referred to
by its dataset name. Once a netCDF dataset is opened, it is referred to
by a netCDF ID, which is a small nonnegative integer returned when you
create or open the dataset. A netCDF ID is much like a file descriptor
in C or a logical unit number in FORTRAN. In any single program, the
netCDF IDs of distinct open netCDF datasets are distinct. A single
netCDF dataset may be opened multiple times and will then have multiple
distinct netCDF IDs; however at most one of the open instances of a
single netCDF dataset should permit writing. When an open netCDF
dataset is closed, the ID is no longer associated with a netCDF dataset.

   Functions that deal with the netCDF library include:
   * Get version of library.

   * Get error message corresponding to a returned error code.

   The operations supported on a netCDF dataset as a single object are:
   * Create, given dataset name and whether to overwrite or not.

   * Open for access, given dataset name and read or write intent.

   * Put into define mode, to add dimensions, variables, or attributes.

   * Take out of define mode, checking consistency of additions.

   * Close, writing to disk if required.

   * Inquire about the number of dimensions, number of variables,
     number of global attributes, and ID of the unlimited dimension, if
     any.

   * Synchronize to disk to make sure it is current.

   * Set and unset nofill mode for optimized sequential writes.

   * After a summary of conventions used in describing the netCDF
     interfaces, the rest of this chapter presents a detailed
     description of the interfaces for these operations.

2.1 NetCDF Library Interface Descriptions
=========================================

Each interface description for a particular netCDF function in this and
later chapters contains:

   * a description of the purpose of the function;

   * a C function prototype that presents the type and order of the
     formal parameters to the function;

   * a description of each formal parameter in the C interface;

   * a list of possible error conditions; and

   * an example of a C program fragment calling the netCDF function (and
     perhaps other netCDF functions).

   The examples follow a simple convention for error handling, always
checking the error status returned from each netCDF function call and
calling a handle_error function in case an error was detected. For an

2.2 Get error message corresponding to error status: nc_strerror
================================================================

The function nc_strerror returns a static reference to an error message
string corresponding to an integer netCDF error status or to a system
error number, presumably returned by a previous call to some other
netCDF function. The list of netCDF error status codes is available in
the appropriate include file for each language binding.

Usage
=====

     const char * nc_strerror(int ncerr);

`ncerr'
     An error status that might have been returned from a previous call
     to some netCDF function.

Errors
======

If you provide an invalid integer error status that does not correspond
to any netCDF error message or or to any system error message (as
understood by the system strerror function), nc_strerror returns a
string indicating that there is no such error status.

Example
=======

Here is an example of a simple error handling function that uses
nc_strerror to print the error message corresponding to the netCDF
error status returned from any netCDF function call and then exit:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     void handle_error(int status) {
     if (status != NC_NOERR) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", nc_strerror(status));
        exit(-1);
        }
     }

2.3 Get netCDF library version: nc_inq_libvers
==============================================

The function nc_inq_libvers returns a string identifying the version of
the netCDF library, and when it was built.

Usage
=====

     const char * nc_inq_libvers(void);

Errors
======

This function takes no arguments, and thus no errors are possible in
its invocation.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_inq_libvers to print the version of the
netCDF library with which the program is linked:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
        printf("%s\n", nc_inq_libvers());

2.4 Create a NetCDF Dataset: nc_create
======================================

This function creates a new netCDF dataset, returning a netCDF ID that
can subsequently be used to refer to the netCDF dataset in other netCDF
function calls. The new netCDF dataset opened for write access and
placed in define mode, ready for you to add dimensions, variables, and
attributes.

   A creation mode flag specifies:

   * whether to overwrite any existing dataset with the same name,

   * whether access to the dataset is shared,

   * whether this file should be in netCDF classic format (the
     default), or the new 64-bit offset format.

Usage
=====

     int nc_create (const char* path, int cmode, int *ncidp);

`path'
     The file name of the new netCDF dataset.

`cmode'
     The creation mode flag. The following flags are available:
     NC_NOCLOBBER, NC_SHARE, and NC_64BIT_OFFSET.

     Setting NC_NOCLOBBER means you do not want to clobber (overwrite)
     an existing dataset; an error (NC_EEXIST) is returned if the
     specified dataset already exists.

     The NC_SHARE flag is appropriate when one process may be writing
     the dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
     concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
     caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
     sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially
     may see some performance improvement by setting the NC_SHARE flag.

     Setting NC_64BIT_OFFSET causes netCDF to create a 64-bit offset
     format file, instead of a netCDF classic format file. The 64-bit
     offset format imposes far fewer restrictions on very large (i.e.
     over 2 GB) data files. *Note Large File Support: (netcdf)Large
     File Support.

     A zero value (defined for convenience as NC_CLOBBER) specifies the
     default behavior: overwrite any existing dataset with the same file
     name and buffer and cache accesses for efficiency. The dataset
     will be in netCDF classic format. *Note NetCDF Classic Format
     Limitations: (netcdf)NetCDF Classic Format Limitations.

`ncidp'
     Pointer to location where returned netCDF ID is to be stored.

Errors
======

nc_create returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Possible
causes of errors include:
   * Passing a dataset name that includes a directory that does not
     exist.

   * Specifying a dataset name of a file that exists and also specifying
     NC_NOCLOBBER.

   * Specifying a meaningless value for the creation mode.

   * Attempting to create a netCDF dataset in a directory where you
     don't have permission to create files.

Examples
========

In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo.nc; we want the
dataset to be created in the current directory only if a dataset with
that name does not already exist:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

   In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo_large.nc. It
will be in the 64-bit offset format.

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER | NC_64BIT_OFFSET, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

   A variant of nc_create, nc__create (note the double underscore)
allows users to specify two tuning parameters for the file that it is
creating. These tuning parameters are not written to the data file,
they are only used for so long as the file remains open after an
nc__create.

Usage
=====

     int nc__create(const char *path, int cmode, size_t initialsz,
                    size_t *chunksizehintp, int *ncidp);

`path'
     The file name of the new netCDF dataset.

`cmode'
     The creation mode flag. The following flags are available:
     NC_NOCLOBBER, NC_SHARE, and NC_64BIT_OFFSET.

     Setting NC_NOCLOBBER means you do not want to clobber (overwrite)
     an existing dataset; an error (NC_EEXIST) is returned if the
     specified dataset already exists.

     The NC_SHARE flag is appropriate when one process may be writing
     the dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
     concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
     caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
     sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially
     may see some performance improvement by setting the NC_SHARE flag.

     Setting NC_64BIT_OFFSET causes netCDF to create a 64-bit offset
     format file, instead of a netCDF classic format file. The 64-bit
     offset format imposes far fewer restrictions on very large (i.e.
     over 2 GB) data files. *Note Large File Support: (netcdf)Large
     File Support.

     A zero value (defined for convenience as NC_CLOBBER) specifies the
     default behavior: overwrite any existing dataset with the same file
     name and buffer and cache accesses for efficiency. The dataset
     will be in netCDF classic format. *Note NetCDF Classic Format
     Limitations: (netcdf)NetCDF Classic Format Limitations.

`initialsz'
     On some systems, and with custom I/O layers, it may be
     advantageous to set the size of the output file at creation time.
     This parameter sets the initial size of the file at creation time.

`chunksizehintp'
     The argument referenced by chunksizehintp controls a space versus
     time tradeoff, memory allocated in the netcdf library versus
     number of system calls.

     Because of internal requirements, the value may not be set to
     exactly the value requested. The actual value chosen is returned
     by reference.

     Using the value NC_SIZEHINT_DEFAULT causes the library to choose a
     default. How the system chooses the default depends on the system.
     On many systems, the "preferred I/O block size" is available from
     the stat() system call, struct stat member st_blksize. If this is
     available it is used. Lacking that, twice the system pagesize is
     used.

     Lacking a call to discover the system pagesize, we just set default
     chunksize to 8192.

     The chunksize is a property of a given open netcdf descriptor
     ncid, it is not a persistent property of the netcdf dataset.

`ncidp'
     Pointer to location where returned netCDF ID is to be stored.

Errors
======

nc__create returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Possible
causes of errors include:
   * Passing a dataset name that includes a directory that does not
     exist.

   * Specifying a dataset name of a file that exists and also specifying
     NC_NOCLOBBER.

   * Specifying a meaningless value for the creation mode.

   * Attempting to create a netCDF dataset in a directory where you
     don't have permission to create files.

   In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo_large.nc; we
want the dataset to be created in the current directory only if a
dataset with that name does not already exist. We also specify that
chunksize and initial size for the file.

     #include <netcdf.h>

     int status;
     int ncid;
     int intialsz = 2048;

2.5 Create a NetCDF Dataset With Performance Options: nc__create
================================================================

This function is a variant of nc_create, nc__create (note the double
underscore) allows users to specify two tuning parameters for the file
that it is creating. These tuning parameters are not written to the
data file, they are only used for so long as the file remains open

   This function creates a new netCDF dataset, returning a netCDF ID
that can subsequently be used to refer to the netCDF dataset in other
netCDF function calls. The new netCDF dataset opened for write access
and placed in define mode, ready for you to add dimensions, variables,
and attributes.

   A creation mode flag specifies whether to overwrite any existing
dataset with the same name and whether access to the dataset is shared,
and whether this file should be in netCDF classic format (the default),
or the new 64-bit offset format.

Usage
=====

     int nc__create(const char *path, int cmode, size_t initialsz,
                    size_t *chunksizehintp, int *ncidp);

`path'
     The file name of the new netCDF dataset.

`cmode'
     The creation mode flag. The following flags are available:
     NC_NOCLOBBER, NC_SHARE, and NC_64BIT_OFFSET.

     Setting NC_NOCLOBBER means you do not want to clobber (overwrite)
     an existing dataset; an error (NC_EEXIST) is returned if the
     specified dataset already exists.

     The NC_SHARE flag is appropriate when one process may be writing

`initialsz'
     This parameter sets the initial size of the file at creation time.

`chunksizehintp'
     The argument referenced by chunksizehintp controls a space versus
     time tradeoff, memory allocated in the netcdf library versus
     number of system calls.

     Because of internal requirements, the value may not be set to

     Pointer to location where returned netCDF ID is to be stored.

Errors
======

nc_create returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Possible
causes of errors include:
   * Passing a dataset name that includes a directory that does not
     exist.

   * Specifying a dataset name of a file that exists and also specifying
     NC_NOCLOBBER.

2.6 Open a NetCDF Dataset for Access: nc_open
=============================================

The function nc_open opens an existing netCDF dataset for access.

Usage
=====

     int nc_open (const char *path, int omode, int *ncidp);

`path'
     File name for netCDF dataset to be opened.

`omode'
     A zero value (or NC_NOWRITE) specifies the default behavior: open
     the dataset with read-only access, buffering and caching accesses
     for efficiency

     Otherwise, the creation mode is NC_WRITE, NC_SHARE, or
     NC_WRITE|NC_SHARE. Setting the NC_WRITE flag opens the dataset with
     read-write access. ("Writing" means any kind of change to the
     dataset, including appending or changing data, adding or renaming
     dimensions, variables, and attributes, or deleting attributes.)
     The NC_SHARE flag is appropriate when one process may be writing
     the dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
     concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
     caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
     sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially
     may see some performance improvement by setting the NC_SHARE flag.

`ncidp'

======

nc_open returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:

performance tuning parameter.

Usage
=====

     int nc__open(const char *path, int mode, size_t *chunksizehintp, int *ncidp);

`path'
     File name for netCDF dataset to be opened.

`omode'
     A zero value (or NC_NOWRITE) specifies the default behavior: open
     the dataset with read-only access, buffering and caching accesses
     for efficiency

     Otherwise, the creation mode is NC_WRITE, NC_SHARE, or
     NC_WRITE|NC_SHARE. Setting the NC_WRITE flag opens the dataset with
     read-write access. ("Writing" means any kind of change to the

2.8 Put Open NetCDF Dataset into Define Mode: nc_redef
======================================================

The function nc_redef puts an open netCDF dataset into define mode, so
dimensions, variables, and attributes can be added or renamed and
attributes can be deleted.

Usage
=====

     int nc_redef(int ncid);

`ncid'
     netCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

Errors
======

nc_redef returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The specified netCDF dataset is already in define mode.

   * The specified netCDF dataset was opened for read-only.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_redef to open an existing netCDF dataset
named foo.nc and put it into define mode:

     #include <netcdf.h>

2.9 Leave Define Mode: nc_enddef
================================

The function nc_enddef takes an open netCDF dataset out of define mode.
The changes made to the netCDF dataset while it was in define mode are
checked and committed to disk if no problems occurred. Non-record
variables may be initialized to a "fill value" as well. *Note
nc_set_fill::. The netCDF dataset is then placed in data mode, so
variable data can be read or written.

   This call may involve copying data under some circumstances. For a
more extensive discussion see *Note File Structure and Performance:
(netcdf)File Structure and Performance.

Usage
=====

     int nc_enddef(int ncid);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

Errors
======

nc_enddef returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The specified netCDF dataset is not in define mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * The size of one or more variables exceed the size constraints for
     whichever variant of the file format is in use).  *Note Large File
     Support: (netcdf)Large File Support.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_enddef to finish the definitions of a new

2.10 Leave Define Mode with Performance Tuning: nc__enddef
==========================================================

The function nc__enddef takes an open netCDF dataset out of define
mode. The changes made to the netCDF dataset while it was in define
mode are checked and committed to disk if no problems occurred.
Non-record variables may be initialized to a "fill value" as well.
*Note nc_set_fill::. The netCDF dataset is then placed in data mode, so
variable data can be read or written.

   This call may involve copying data under some circumstances. For a
more extensive discussion see *Note File Structure and Performance:
(netcdf)File Structure and Performance.

   Caution: this function exposes internals of the netcdf version 1 file
format. Users should use nc_enddef in most circumstances. This function
may not be available on future netcdf implementations.

   The current netcdf file format has three sections, the "header"
section, the data section for fixed size variables, and the data
section for variables which have an unlimited dimension (record
variables).

   The header begins at the beginning of the file. The index (offset) of
the beginning of the other two sections is contained in the header.
Typically, there is no space between the sections. This causes copying
overhead to accrue if one wishes to change the size of the sections, as
may happen when changing names of things, text attribute values, adding
attributes or adding variables. Also, for buffered i/o, there may be
advantages to aligning sections in certain ways.

   The minfree parameters allow one to control costs of future calls to
nc_redef, nc_enddef by requesting that minfree bytes be available at
the end of the section.

   The align parameters allow one to set the alignment of the beginning
of the corresponding sections. The beginning of the section is rounded
up to an index which is a multiple of the align parameter. The flag
value ALIGN_CHUNK tells the library to use the chunksize (see above) as
the align parameter.

   The file format requires mod 4 alignment, so the align parameters
are silently rounded up to multiples of 4. The usual call,

     nc_enddef(ncid);

   is equivalent to

     nc_enddef(ncid, 0, 4, 0, 4);

   The file format does not contain a "record size" value, this is
calculated from the sizes of the record variables. This unfortunate
fact prevents us from providing minfree and alignment control of the
"records" in a netcdf file. If you add a variable which has an
unlimited dimension, the third section will always be copied with the
new variable added.

Usage
=====

     int nc__enddef(int ncid, size_t h_minfree, size_t v_align,
                    size_t v_minfree, size_t r_align);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`h_minfree'
     Sets the pad at the end of the "header" section.

`v_align'
     Controls the alignment of the beginning of the data section for
     fixed size variables.

`v_minfree'
     Sets the pad at the end of the data section for fixed size
     variables.

`r_align'
     Controls the alignment of the beginning of the data section for
     variables which have an unlimited dimension (record variables).


Errors
======

nc__enddef returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The specified netCDF dataset is not in define mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * The size of one or more variables exceed the size constraints for
     whichever variant of the file format is in use).  *Note Large File
     Support: (netcdf)Large File Support.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_enddef to finish the definitions of a new
netCDF dataset named foo.nc and put it into data mode:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...       /* create dimensions, variables, attributes */

     status = nc_enddef(ncid);  /*leave define mode*/
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.11 Close an Open NetCDF Dataset: nc_close
===========================================

The function nc_close closes an open netCDF dataset. If the dataset is
in define mode, nc_enddef will be called before closing. (In this case,
if nc_enddef returns an error, nc_abort will automatically be called to
restore the dataset to the consistent state before define mode was last
entered.) After an open netCDF dataset is closed, its netCDF ID may be
reassigned to the next netCDF dataset that is opened or created.

Usage
=====

     int nc_close(int ncid);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

Errors
======

nc_close returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * Define mode was entered and the automatic call made to nc_enddef
     failed.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_close to finish the definitions of a new
netCDF dataset named foo.nc and release its netCDF ID:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...       /* create dimensions, variables, attributes */

     status = nc_close(ncid);       /* close netCDF dataset */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.12 Inquire about an Open NetCDF Dataset: nc_inq Family
========================================================

Members of the nc_inq family of functions return information about an
open netCDF dataset, given its netCDF ID. Dataset inquire functions may
be called from either define mode or data mode. The first function,
nc_inq, returns values for the number of dimensions, the number of
variables, the number of global attributes, and the dimension ID of the
dimension defined with unlimited length, if any. The other functions in
the family each return just one of these items of information.

   For C, these functions include nc_inq, nc_inq_ndims, nc_inq_nvars,
nc_inq_natts, and nc_inq_unlimdim.  An additional function,
nc_inq_format, returns the (rarely needed) format version.

   No I/O is performed when these functions are called, since the
required information is available in memory for each open netCDF
dataset.

Usage
=====

     int nc_inq          (int ncid, int *ndimsp, int *nvarsp, int *ngattsp,
                          int *unlimdimidp);
     int nc_inq_ndims    (int ncid, int *ndimsp);
     int nc_inq_nvars    (int ncid, int *nvarsp);
     int nc_inq_natts    (int ncid, int *ngattsp);
     int nc_inq_unlimdim (int ncid, int *unlimdimidp);
     int nc_inq_format   (int ncid, int *formatp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`ndimsp'
     Pointer to location for returned number of dimensions defined for
     this netCDF dataset.

`nvarsp'
     Pointer to location for returned number of variables defined for
     this netCDF dataset.

`ngattsp'
     Pointer to location for returned number of global attributes
     defined for this netCDF dataset.

`unlimdimidp'
     Pointer to location for returned ID of the unlimited dimension, if
     there is one for this netCDF dataset. If no unlimited length
     dimension has been defined, -1 is returned.

`formatp'
     Pointer to location for returned format version, one of
     NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC, NC_FORMAT_64BIT, NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4,
     NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4_CLASSIC.

Errors
======

All members of the nc_inq family return the value NC_NOERR if no errors
occurred. Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible
causes of errors include:
   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_inq to find out about a netCDF dataset
named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status, ncid, ndims, nvars, ngatts, unlimdimid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_NOWRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq(ncid, &ndims, &nvars, &ngatts, &unlimdimid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.13 Synchronize an Open NetCDF Dataset to Disk: nc_sync
========================================================

The function nc_sync offers a way to synchronize the disk copy of a
netCDF dataset with in-memory buffers. There are two reasons you might
want to synchronize after writes:
   * To minimize data loss in case of abnormal termination, or

   * To make data available to other processes for reading immediately
     after it is written. But note that a process that already had the
     dataset open for reading would not see the number of records
     increase when the writing process calls nc_sync; to accomplish
     this, the reading process must call nc_sync.

   This function is backward-compatible with previous versions of the
netCDF library. The intent was to allow sharing of a netCDF dataset
among multiple readers and one writer, by having the writer call
nc_sync after writing and the readers call nc_sync before each read.
For a writer, this flushes buffers to disk. For a reader, it makes sure
that the next read will be from disk rather than from previously cached
buffers, so that the reader will see changes made by the writing
process (e.g., the number of records written) without having to close
and reopen the dataset. If you are only accessing a small amount of
data, it can be expensive in computer resources to always synchronize
to disk after every write, since you are giving up the benefits of
buffering.

   An easier way to accomplish sharing (and what is now recommended) is
to have the writer and readers open the dataset with the NC_SHARE flag,
and then it will not be necessary to call nc_sync at all. However, the
nc_sync function still provides finer granularity than the NC_SHARE
flag, if only a few netCDF accesses need to be synchronized among
processes.

   It is important to note that changes to the ancillary data, such as
attribute values, are not propagated automatically by use of the
NC_SHARE flag. Use of the nc_sync function is still required for this
purpose.

   Sharing datasets when the writer enters define mode to change the
data schema requires extra care. In previous releases, after the writer
left define mode, the readers were left looking at an old copy of the
dataset, since the changes were made to a new copy. The only way
readers could see the changes was by closing and reopening the dataset.
Now the changes are made in place, but readers have no knowledge that
their internal tables are now inconsistent with the new dataset schema.
If netCDF datasets are shared across redefinition, some mechanism
external to the netCDF library must be provided that prevents access by
readers during redefinition and causes the readers to call nc_sync
before any subsequent access.

   When calling nc_sync, the netCDF dataset must be in data mode. A
netCDF dataset in define mode is synchronized to disk only when
nc_enddef is called. A process that is reading a netCDF dataset that
another process is writing may call nc_sync to get updated with the
changes made to the data by the writing process (e.g., the number of
records written), without having to close and reopen the dataset.

   Data is automatically synchronized to disk when a netCDF dataset is
closed, or whenever you leave define mode.

Usage
=====

     int nc_sync(int ncid);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

Errors
======

nc_sync returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The netCDF dataset is in define mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_sync to synchronize the disk writes of a
netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);  /* open for writing */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...           /* write data or change attributes */

     status = nc_sync(ncid);      /* synchronize to disk */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.14 Back Out of Recent Definitions: nc_abort
=============================================

You no longer need to call this function, since it is called
automatically by nc_close in case the dataset is in define mode and
something goes wrong with committing the changes. The function nc_abort
just closes the netCDF dataset, if not in define mode. If the dataset
is being created and is still in define mode, the dataset is deleted.
If define mode was entered by a call to nc_redef, the netCDF dataset is
restored to its state before definition mode was entered and the
dataset is closed.

Usage
=====

     int nc_abort(int ncid);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

Errors
======

nc_abort returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * When called from define mode while creating a netCDF dataset,
     deletion of the dataset failed.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_abort to back out of redefinitions of a
dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int ncid, status, latid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);/* open for writing */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_redef(ncid);                    /* enter define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_def_dim(ncid, "lat", 18L, &latid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) {
        handle_error(status);
        status = nc_abort(ncid);                 /* define failed, abort */
        if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     }

2.15 Set Fill Mode for Writes: nc_set_fill
==========================================

This function is intended for advanced usage, to optimize writes under
some circumstances described below. The function nc_set_fill sets the
fill mode for a netCDF dataset open for writing and returns the current
fill mode in a return parameter. The fill mode can be specified as
either NC_FILL or NC_NOFILL. The default behavior corresponding to
NC_FILL is that data is pre-filled with fill values, that is fill
values are written when you create non-record variables or when you
write a value beyond data that has not yet been written. This makes it
possible to detect attempts to read data before it was written. For
more information on the use of fill values see *Note Fill Values::. For
information about how to define your own fill values see *Note
Attribute Conventions: (netcdf)Attribute Conventions.

   The behavior corresponding to NC_NOFILL overrides the default
behavior of prefilling data with fill values. This can be used to
enhance performance, because it avoids the duplicate writes that occur
when the netCDF library writes fill values that are later overwritten
with data.

   A value indicating which mode the netCDF dataset was already in is
returned. You can use this value to temporarily change the fill mode of
an open netCDF dataset and then restore it to the previous mode.

   After you turn on NC_NOFILL mode for an open netCDF dataset, you must
be certain to write valid data in all the positions that will later be
read. Note that nofill mode is only a transient property of a netCDF
dataset open for writing: if you close and reopen the dataset, it will
revert to the default behavior. You can also revert to the default
behavior by calling nc_set_fill again to explicitly set the fill mode
to NC_FILL.

   There are three situations where it is advantageous to set nofill
mode:
  1. Creating and initializing a netCDF dataset. In this case, you
     should set nofill mode before calling nc_enddef and then write
     completely all non-record variables and the initial records of all
     the record variables you want to initialize.

  2. Extending an existing record-oriented netCDF dataset. Set nofill
     mode after opening the dataset for writing, then append the
     additional records to the dataset completely, leaving no
     intervening unwritten records.

  3. Adding new variables that you are going to initialize to an
     existing netCDF dataset. Set nofill mode before calling nc_enddef
     then write all the new variables completely.

   If the netCDF dataset has an unlimited dimension and the last record
was written while in nofill mode, then the dataset may be shorter than
if nofill mode was not set, but this will be completely transparent if
you access the data only through the netCDF interfaces.

   The use of this feature may not be available (or even needed) in
future releases. Programmers are cautioned against heavy reliance upon
this feature.

Usage
=====

     int nc_set_fill (int ncid, int fillmode, int *old_modep);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`fillmode'
     Desired fill mode for the dataset, either NC_NOFILL or NC_FILL.

`old_modep'
     Pointer to location for returned current fill mode of the dataset
     before this call, either NC_NOFILL or NC_FILL.

Errors
======

nc_set_fill returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID refers to a dataset open for read-only
     access.

   * The fill mode argument is neither NC_NOFILL nor NC_FILL..

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_set_fill to set nofill mode for subsequent
writes of a netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int ncid, status, old_fill_mode;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);  /* open for writing */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...           /* write data with default prefilling behavior */

     status = nc_set_fill(ncid, NC_NOFILL, &old_fill_mode); /* set nofill */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...           /* write data with no prefilling */

2.16 Set Default Creation Format: nc_set_default_format
=======================================================

This function is intended for advanced users.

   Starting in version 3.6, netCDF introduced a new data format, the
first change in the underlying binary data format since the netCDF
interface was released. The new format, 64-bit offset format, was
introduced to greatly relax the limitations on creating very large
files.

   Users are warned that creating files in the 64-bit offset format
makes them unreadable by the netCDF library prior to version 3.6.0. For
reasons of compatibility, users should continue to create files in
netCDF classic format.

   Users who do want to use 64-bit offset format files can create them
directory from nc_create, using the proper cmode flag.  (*note
nc_create::).

   The function nc_set_default_format allows the user to change the
format of the netCDF file to be created by future calls to nc_create
(or nc__create) without changing the cmode flag.

   This allows the user to convert a program to use 64-bit offset
formation without changing all calls the nc_create. *Note Large File
Support: (netcdf)Large File Support.

   Once the default format is set, all future created files will be in
the desired format.

   Two constants are provided in the netcdf.h file to be used with this
function, NC_FORMAT_64BIT and NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC.

   If a non-NULL pointer is provided, it is assumed to point to an int,
where the existing default format will be written.

   Using nc_create with a cmode including NC_64BIT_OFFSET overrides the
default format, and creates a 64-bit offset file.

Usage
=====

     int nc_set_default_format(int format, int *old_formatp);

`format'
     Either NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC (the default setting) or NC_FORMAT_64BIT.

`old_formatp'
     Either NULL (in which case it will be ignored), or a pointer to an
     int where the existing default format (i.e. before being changed
     to the new format) will be written. This allows you to get the
     existing default format while setting a new default format.


Errors
======

nc_set_default_format returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * Invalid format. The only valid formats are NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC and
     NC_FORMAT_64BIT. Trying to set the default format to something else
     will result in an invalid argument error. (NC_EINVAL)


Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_set_default_format to create the same file
in both formats with the same nc_create call:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int ncid, status, old_fill_mode;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);  /* open for writing */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...           /* write data with default prefilling behavior */

     status = nc_set_fill(ncid, NC_NOFILL, &old_fill_mode); /* set nofill */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...           /* write data with no prefilling */

3.1 Dimensions Introduction
===========================

Dimensions for a netCDF dataset are defined when it is created, while
the netCDF dataset is in define mode. Additional dimensions may be
added later by reentering define mode. A netCDF dimension has a name
and a length. At most one dimension in a netCDF dataset can have the
unlimited length, which means variables using this dimension can grow
along this dimension.

   There is a suggested limit (1024) to the number of dimensions that
can be defined in a single netCDF dataset. The limit is the value of the
predefined macro NC_MAX_DIMS. The purpose of the limit is to make
writing generic applications simpler. They need only provide an array
of NC_MAX_DIMS dimensions to handle any netCDF dataset. The
implementation of the netCDF library does not enforce this advisory
maximum, so it is possible to use more dimensions, if necessary, but
netCDF utilities that assume the advisory maximums may not be able to
handle the resulting netCDF datasets.

   Ordinarily, the name and length of a dimension are fixed when the
dimension is first defined. The name may be changed later, but the
length of a dimension (other than the unlimited dimension) cannot be
changed without copying all the data to a new netCDF dataset with a
redefined dimension length.

   Dimension lengths in the C interface are type size_t rather than type
int to make it possible to access all the data in a netCDF dataset on a
platform that only supports a 16-bit int data type, for example MSDOS.
If dimension lengths were type int instead, it would not be possible to
access data from variables with a dimension length greater than a
16-bit int can accommodate.

   A netCDF dimension in an open netCDF dataset is referred to by a
small integer called a dimension ID. In the C interface, dimension IDs
are 0, 1, 2, ..., in the order in which the dimensions were defined.

   Operations supported on dimensions are:
   * Create a dimension, given its name and length.

   * Get a dimension ID from its name.

   * Get a dimension's name and length from its ID.

   * Rename a dimension.

3.2 Create a Dimension: nc_def_dim
==================================

The function nc_def_dim adds a new dimension to an open netCDF dataset
in define mode. It returns (as an argument) a dimension ID, given the
netCDF ID, the dimension name, and the dimension length. At most one
unlimited length dimension, called the record dimension, may be defined
for each netCDF dataset.

Usage
=====

     int nc_def_dim (int ncid, const char *name, size_t len, int *dimidp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`name'
     Dimension name. Must begin with an alphabetic character, followed
     by zero or more alphanumeric characters including the underscore
     ('_'). Case is significant.

`len'
     Length of dimension; that is, number of values for this dimension
     as an index to variables that use it. This should be either a
     positive integer (of type size_t) or the predefined constant
     NC_UNLIMITED.

`dimidp'
     Pointer to location for returned dimension ID.

Errors
======

nc_def_dim returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The netCDF dataset is not in definition mode.

   * The specified dimension name is the name of another existing
     dimension.

   * The specified length is not greater than zero.

   * The specified length is unlimited, but there is already an
     unlimited length dimension defined for this netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.


Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_def_dim to create a dimension named lat of
length 18 and a unlimited dimension named rec in a new netCDF dataset

3.3 Get a Dimension ID from Its Name: nc_inq_dimid
==================================================

The function nc_inq_dimid returns (as an argument) the ID of a netCDF
dimension, given the name of the dimension. If ndims is the number of
dimensions defined for a netCDF dataset, each dimension has an ID
between 0 and ndims-1.

Usage
=====

int nc_inq_dimid (int ncid, const char *name, int *dimidp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`name'
     Dimension name, a character string beginning with a letter and
     followed by any sequence of letters, digits, or underscore ('_')
     characters. Case is significant in dimension names.

`dimidp'
     Pointer to location for the returned dimension ID.


Errors
======

nc_inq_dimid returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   The name that was specified is not the name of a dimension in the
netCDF dataset.  The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open
netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_inq_dimid to determine the dimension ID of
a dimension named lat, assumed to have been defined previously in an
existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>

     int status, ncid, latid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_NOWRITE, &ncid);  /* open for reading */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

3.4 Inquire about a Dimension: nc_inq_dim Family
================================================

This family of functions returns information about a netCDF dimension.
Information about a dimension includes its name and its length. The
length for the unlimited dimension, if any, is the number of records
written so far.

   The functions in this family include nc_inq_dim, nc_inq_dimname, and
nc_inq_dimlen. The function nc_inq_dim returns all the information
about a dimension; the other functions each return just one item of
information.

Usage
=====

     int nc_inq_dim     (int ncid, int dimid, char* name, size_t* lengthp);
     int nc_inq_dimname (int ncid, int dimid, char *name);
     int nc_inq_dimlen  (int ncid, int dimid, size_t *lengthp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`dimid'
     Dimension ID, from a previous call to nc_inq_dimid or nc_def_dim.

`name'
     Returned dimension name. The caller must allocate space for the
     returned name. The maximum possible length, in characters, of a
     dimension name is given by the predefined constant NC_MAX_NAME.
     (This doesn't include the null terminator, so declare your array
     to be size NC_MAX_NAME+1). The returned character array will be
     null-terminated.

`lengthp'
     Pointer to location for returned length of dimension. For the
     unlimited dimension, this is the number of records written so far.


Errors
======

These functions return the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The dimension ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.


Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_inq_dim to determine the length of a
dimension named lat, and the name and current maximum length of the
unlimited dimension for an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status, ncid, latid, recid;
     size_t latlength, recs;
     char recname[NC_MAX_NAME+1];
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_NOWRITE, &ncid);  /* open for reading */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_inq_unlimdim(ncid, &recid); /* get ID of unlimited dimension */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_dimid(ncid, "lat", &latid);  /* get ID for lat dimension */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_inq_dimlen(ncid, latid, &latlength); /* get lat length */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     /* get unlimited dimension name and current length */
     status = nc_inq_dim(ncid, recid, recname, &recs);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

3.5 Rename a Dimension: nc_rename_dim
=====================================

The function nc_rename_dim renames an existing dimension in a netCDF
dataset open for writing. If the new name is longer than the old name,
the netCDF dataset must be in define mode. You cannot rename a
dimension to have the same name as another dimension.

Usage
=====

int nc_rename_dim(int ncid, int dimid, const char* name);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`dimid'
     Dimension ID, from a previous call to nc_inq_dimid or nc_def_dim.

`name'
     New dimension name.


Errors
======

nc_rename_dim returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The new name is the name of another dimension.

   * The dimension ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * The new name is longer than the old name and the netCDF dataset is
     not in define mode.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_rename_dim to rename the dimension lat to
latitude in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status, ncid, latid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);  /* open for writing */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_redef(ncid);  /* put in define mode to rename dimension */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_inq_dimid(ncid, "lat", &latid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_rename_dim(ncid, latid, "latitude");
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_enddef(ncid); /* leave define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

4.1 Introduction
================

Variables for a netCDF dataset are defined when the dataset is created,
while the netCDF dataset is in define mode. Other variables may be
added later by reentering define mode. A netCDF variable has a name, a
type, and a shape, which are specified when it is defined. A variable
may also have values, which are established later in data mode.

   Ordinarily, the name, type, and shape are fixed when the variable is
first defined. The name may be changed, but the type and shape of a
variable cannot be changed. However, a variable defined in terms of the
unlimited dimension can grow without bound in that dimension.

   A netCDF variable in an open netCDF dataset is referred to by a small
integer called a variable ID.

   Variable IDs reflect the order in which variables were defined within
a netCDF dataset. Variable IDs are 0, 1, 2,..., in the order in which
the variables were defined. A function is available for getting the
variable ID from the variable name and vice-versa.

   Attributes (*note Attributes::) may be associated with a variable to
specify such properties as units.

   Operations supported on variables are:
   * Create a variable, given its name, data type, and shape.

   * Get a variable ID from its name.

   * Get a variable's name, data type, shape, and number of attributes
     from its ID.

   * Put a data value into a variable, given variable ID, indices, and
     value.

   * Put an array of values into a variable, given variable ID, corner
     indices, edge lengths, and a block of values.

   * Put a subsampled or mapped array-section of values into a variable,
     given variable ID, corner indices, edge lengths, stride vector,
     index mapping vector, and a block of values.

   * Get a data value from a variable, given variable ID and indices.

   * Get an array of values from a variable, given variable ID, corner
     indices, and edge lengths.

   * Get a subsampled or mapped array-section of values from a variable,
     given variable ID, corner indices, edge lengths, stride vector, and
     index mapping vector.

   * Rename a variable.

4.2 Language Types Corresponding to netCDF external data types
==============================================================

The following table gives the netCDF external data types and the
corresponding type constants for defining variables in the C interface:

Type               C #define                                   Bits
byte               NC_BYTE                                     8
char               NC_CHAR                                     8
short              NC_SHORT                                    16
int                NC_INT                                      32
float              NC_FLOAT                                    32
double             NC_DOUBLE                                   64

   The first column gives the netCDF external data type, which is the
same as the CDL data type. The next column gives the corresponding C
preprocessor macro for use in netCDF functions (the preprocessor macros
are defined in the netCDF C header-file netcdf.h). The last column
gives the number of bits used in the external representation of values
of the corresponding type.

   Note that there are no netCDF types corresponding to 64-bit integers
or to characters wider than 8 bits in the current version of the netCDF
library.

4.3 Create a Variable: `nc_def_var'
===================================

The function nc_def_var adds a new variable to an open netCDF dataset
in define mode. It returns (as an argument) a variable ID, given the
netCDF ID, the variable name, the variable type, the number of
dimensions, and a list of the dimension IDs.

Usage
=====

     int nc_def_var (int ncid, const char *name, nc_type xtype,
                     int ndims, const int dimids[], int *varidp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`name'
     Variable name. Must begin with an alphabetic character, followed by
     zero or more alphanumeric characters including the underscore
     ('_'). Case is significant.

`xtype'
     One of the set of predefined netCDF external data types. The type
     of this parameter, nc_type, is defined in the netCDF header file.
     The valid netCDF external data types are NC_BYTE, NC_CHAR,
     NC_SHORT, NC_INT, NC_FLOAT, and NC_DOUBLE.

`ndims'
     Number of dimensions for the variable. For example, 2 specifies a
     matrix, 1 specifies a vector, and 0 means the variable is a scalar
     with no dimensions. Must not be negative or greater than the
     predefined constant NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS.

`dimids'
     Vector of ndims dimension IDs corresponding to the variable
     dimensions. If the ID of the unlimited dimension is included, it
     must be first. This argument is ignored if ndims is 0.

`varidp'
     Pointer to location for the returned variable ID.

Errors
======

nc_def_var returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:

   * The netCDF dataset is not in define mode.

   * The specified variable name is the name of another existing
     variable.

   * The specified type is not a valid netCDF type.

   * The specified number of dimensions is negative or more than the
     constant NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS, the maximum number of dimensions
     permitted for a netCDF variable.

   * One or more of the dimension IDs in the list of dimensions is not a
     valid dimension ID for the netCDF dataset.

   * The number of variables would exceed the constant NC_MAX_VARS, the
     maximum number of variables permitted in a netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_def_var to create a variable named rh of
type double with three dimensions, time, lat, and lon in a new netCDF
dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;                       /* error status */

     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_def_dim(ncid, "lon", 10L, &lon_dim);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_def_dim(ncid, "time", NC_UNLIMITED, &time_dim);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
                                        /* define variable */
     rh_dimids[0] = time_dim;
     rh_dimids[1] = lat_dim;
     rh_dimids[2] = lon_dim;
     status = nc_def_var (ncid, "rh", NC_DOUBLE, 3, rh_dimids, &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

4.5 Get Information about a Variable from Its ID: nc_inq_var
============================================================

family 

   A family of functions that returns information about a netCDF
variable, given its ID. Information about a variable includes its name,
type, number of dimensions, a list of dimension IDs describing the
shape of the variable, and the number of variable attributes that have
been assigned to the variable.

   The function nc_inq_var returns all the information about a netCDF
variable, given its ID. The other functions each return just one item
of information about a variable.

   These other functions include nc_inq_varname, nc_inq_vartype,
nc_inq_varndims, nc_inq_vardimid, and nc_inq_varnatts.

Usage
=====

     int nc_inq_var      (int ncid, int varid, char *name, nc_type *xtypep,
                          int *ndimsp, int dimids[], int *nattsp);
     int nc_inq_varname  (int ncid, int varid, char *name);
     int nc_inq_vartype  (int ncid, int varid, nc_type *xtypep);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`name'
     Returned variable name. The caller must allocate space for the
     returned name. The maximum possible length, in characters, of a
     variable name is given by the predefined constant NC_MAX_NAME.
     (This doesn't include the null terminator, so declare your array
     to be size NC_MAX_NAME+1). The returned character array will be
     null-terminated.

`xtypep'
     Pointer to location for returned variable type, one of the set of
     predefined netCDF external data types. The type of this parameter,
     nc_type, is defined in the netCDF header file. The valid netCDF
     external data types are NC_BYTE, NC_CHAR, NC_SHORT, NC_INT,
     NC_FLOAT, and NC_DOUBLE.

`ndimsp'
     Pointer to location for returned number of dimensions the variable
     was defined as using. For example, 2 indicates a matrix, 1
     indicates a vector, and 0 means the variable is a scalar with no
     dimensions.

`dimids'
     Returned vector of *ndimsp dimension IDs corresponding to the
     variable dimensions. The caller must allocate enough space for a
     vector of at least *ndimsp integers to be returned. The maximum
     possible number of dimensions for a variable is given by the
     predefined constant NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS.

`nattsp'
     Pointer to location for returned number of variable attributes
     assigned to this variable.

   These functions return the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.  The
specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_inq_var to find out about a variable named

4.6 Write a Single Data Value: nc_put_var1_ TYPE
================================================

The functions nc_put_var1_ TYPE put a single data value of the
specified type into a variable of an open netCDF dataset that is in
data mode. Inputs are the netCDF ID, the variable ID, an index that
specifies which value to add or alter, and the data value. The value is
converted to the external data type of the variable, if necessary.

Usage
=====

     int nc_put_var1_text  (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            const char *tp);
     int nc_put_var1_uchar (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            const unsigned char *up);
     int nc_put_var1_schar (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            const signed char *cp);
     int nc_put_var1_short (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            const short *sp);
     int nc_put_var1_int   (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            const int *ip);
     int nc_put_var1_long  (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            const long *lp);
     int nc_put_var1_float (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            const float *fp);
     int nc_put_var1_double(int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            const double *dp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`index[]'
     The index of the data value to be written. The indices are relative
     to 0, so for example, the first data value of a two-dimensional
     variable would have index (0,0). The elements of index must
     correspond to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the variable
     uses the unlimited dimension, the first index would correspond to
     the unlimited dimension.

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to the data value to be written. If the type of data values
     differs from the netCDF variable type, type conversion will occur.
     *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type Conversion.


Errors
======

nc_put_var1_ TYPE returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified indices were out of range for the rank of the
     specified variable. For example, a negative index or an index that
     is larger than the corresponding dimension length will cause an
     error.

   * The specified value is out of the range of values representable by
     the external data type of the variable.

   * The specified netCDF is in define mode rather than data mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example

Here is an example using nc_put_var1_double to set the (1,2,3) element
of the variable named rh to 0.5 in an existing netCDF dataset named
foo.nc. For simplicity in this example, we assume that we know that rh
is dimensioned with time, lat, and lon, so we want to set the value of
rh that corresponds to the second time value, the third lat value, and
the fourth lon value:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;                          /* error status */
     int  ncid;                            /* netCDF ID */
     int  rh_id;                           /* variable ID */
     static size_t rh_index[] = {1, 2, 3}; /* where to put value */
     static double rh_val = 0.5;           /* value to put */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid, "rh", &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_put_var1_double(ncid, rh_id, rh_index, &rh_val);

4.7 Write an Entire Variable: nc_put_var_ TYPE
==============================================

The nc_put_var_ TYPE family of functions write all the values of a
variable into a netCDF variable of an open netCDF dataset. This is the
simplest interface to use for writing a value in a scalar variable or
whenever all the values of a multidimensional variable can all be
written at once. The values to be written are associated with the
netCDF variable by assuming that the last dimension of the netCDF
variable varies fastest in the C interface. The values are converted to
the external data type of the variable, if necessary.

   Take care when using the simplest forms of this interface with record
variables when you don't specify how many records are to be written. If
you try to write all the values of a record variable into a netCDF file
that has no record data yet (hence has 0 records), nothing will be
written. Similarly, if you try to write all of a record variable but
there are more records in the file than you assume, more data may be
written to the file than you supply, which may result in a segmentation
violation.

     data values differs from the netCDF variable type, type conversion
     will occur. *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type Conversion.


Errors
======

Members of the nc_put_var_ TYPE family return the value NC_NOERR if no
errors occurred. Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error.
Possible causes of errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * One or more of the specified values are out of the range of values
     representable by the external data type of the variable.

   * One or more of the specified values are out of the range of values
     representable by the external data type of the variable.

   * The specified netCDF dataset is in define mode rather than data
     mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

4.8 Write an Array of Values: nc_put_vara_ TYPE
===============================================

The function nc_put_vara_ TYPE writes values into a netCDF variable of
an open netCDF dataset. The part of the netCDF variable to write is
specified by giving a corner and a vector of edge lengths that refer to
an array section of the netCDF variable. The values to be written are
associated with the netCDF variable by assuming that the last dimension
of the netCDF variable varies fastest in the C interface. The netCDF
dataset must be in data mode.

Usage
=====

     int nc_put_vara_ type   (int ncid, int varid, const size_t start[],

     int nc_put_vara_double(int ncid, int varid, const size_t start[],
                            const size_t count[], const double *dp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`start'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the index in the variable
     where the first of the data values will be written. The indices are
     relative to 0, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (0, 0, ... , 0). The size of start must be the
     same as the number of dimensions of the specified variable. The
     elements of start must correspond to the variable's dimensions in
     order. Hence, if the variable is a record variable, the first
     index would correspond to the starting record number for writing
     the data values.

`count'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the edge lengths along each
     dimension of the block of data values to be written. To write a
     single value, for example, specify count as (1, 1, ... , 1). The
     length of count is the number of dimensions of the specified
     variable. The elements of count correspond to the variable's
     dimensions. Hence, if the variable is a record variable, the first
     element of count corresponds to a count of the number of records
     to write.

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to a block of data values to be written. The order in which
     the data will be written to the netCDF variable is with the last
     dimension of the specified variable varying fastest. If the type of
     data values differs from the netCDF variable type, type conversion
     will occur. *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type Conversion.


Errors
======

nc_put_vara_ TYPE returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified corner indices were out of range for the rank of the
     specified variable. For example, a negative index, or an index
     that is larger than the corresponding dimension length will cause
     an error.

   * The specified edge lengths added to the specified corner would have
     referenced data out of range for the rank of the specified
     variable. For example, an edge length that is larger than the
     corresponding dimension length minus the corner index will cause an
     error.

   * One or more of the specified values are out of the range of values
     representable by the external data type of the variable.

   * The specified netCDF dataset is in define mode rather than data
     mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

4.9 Write a Subsampled Array of Values: nc_put_vars_ TYPE
=========================================================

Each member of the family of functions nc_put_vars_ TYPE writes a
subsampled (strided) array section of values into a netCDF variable of
an open netCDF dataset. The subsampled array section is specified by
giving a corner, a vector of counts, and a stride vector. The netCDF
dataset must be in data mode.

Usage

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`start'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the index in the variable
     where the first of the data values will be written. The indices are
     relative to 0, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (0, 0, ... , 0). The elements of start
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first index corresponds to the
     starting record number for writing the data values.

`count'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the number of indices
     selected along each dimension. To write a single value, for
     example, specify count as (1, 1, ... , 1). The elements of count
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first element of count
     corresponds to a count of the number of records to write.

`stride'
     A vector of ptrdiff_t integers that specifies the sampling interval
     along each dimension of the netCDF variable. The elements of the
     stride vector correspond, in order, to the netCDF variable's
     dimensions (stride[0] gives the sampling interval along the most
     slowly varying dimension of the netCDF variable). Sampling
     intervals are specified in type-independent units of elements (a
     value of 1 selects consecutive elements of the netCDF variable
     along the corresponding dimension, a value of 2 selects every
     other element, etc.). A NULL stride argument is treated as (1, 1,
     ... , 1).

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to a block of data values to be written. The order in which
     the data will be written to the netCDF variable is with the last
     dimension of the specified variable varying fastest. If the type of
     data values differs from the netCDF variable type, type conversion
     will occur. *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type Conversion.


Errors
======

nc_put_vars_ TYPE returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified start, count and stride generate an index which is
     out of range.

   * One or more of the specified values are out of the range of values
     representable by the external data type of the variable.

   * The specified netCDF is in define mode rather than data mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

4.10 Write a Mapped Array of Values: nc_put_varm_ TYPE
======================================================

The nc_put_varm_ TYPE family of functions writes a mapped array section
of values into a netCDF variable of an open netCDF dataset. The mapped
array section is specified by giving a corner, a vector of counts, a
stride vector, and an index mapping vector. The index mapping vector is
a vector of integers that specifies the mapping between the dimensions
of a netCDF variable and the in-memory structure of the internal data
array. No assumptions are made about the ordering or length of the
dimensions of the data array. The netCDF dataset must be in data mode.

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`start'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the index in the variable
     where the first of the data values will be written. The indices are
     relative to 0, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (0, 0, ... , 0). The elements of start
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first index corresponds to the
     starting record number for writing the data values.

`count'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the number of indices
     selected along each dimension. To write a single value, for
     example, specify count as (1, 1, ... , 1). The elements of count
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first element of count
     corresponds to a count of the number of records to write.

`stride'
     A vector of ptrdiff_t integers that specifies the sampling interval
     along each dimension of the netCDF variable. The elements of the
     stride vector correspond, in order, to the netCDF variable's
     dimensions (stride[0] gives the sampling interval along the most
     slowly varying dimension of the netCDF variable). Sampling
     intervals are specified in type-independent units of elements (a
     value of 1 selects consecutive elements of the netCDF variable
     along the corresponding dimension, a value of 2 selects every
     other element, etc.). A NULL stride argument is treated as (1, 1,
     ... , 1).

`imap'
     A vector of ptrdiff_t integers that specifies the mapping between
     the dimensions of a netCDF variable and the in-memory structure of
     the internal data array. The elements of the index mapping vector
     correspond, in order, to the netCDF variable's dimensions (imap[0]
     gives the distance between elements of the internal array
     corresponding to the most slowly varying dimension of the netCDF
     variable). Distances between elements are specified in
     type-independent units of elements (the distance between internal
     elements that occupy adjacent memory locations is 1 and not the
     element's byte-length as in netCDF 2). A NULL argument means the
     memory-resident values have the same structure as the associated
     netCDF variable.

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to the location used for computing where the data values
     will be found; the data should be of the type appropriate for the
     function called. If the type of data values differs from the
     netCDF variable type, type conversion will occur. *Note Type
     Conversion: (netcdf)Type Conversion.


Errors
======

nc_put_varm_ TYPE returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified start, count, and stride generate an index which is
     out of range. Note that no error checking is possible on the imap
     vector.

   * One or more of the specified values are out of the range of values
     representable by the external data type of the variable.

   * The specified netCDF is in define mode rather than data mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.


Example
=======

The following imap vector maps in the trivial way a 4x3x2 netCDF
variable and an internal array of the same shape:

     float a[4][3][2];       /* same shape as netCDF variable */
     int   imap[3] = {6, 2, 1};
                             /* netCDF dimension       inter-element distance */
                             /* ----------------       ---------------------- */
                             /* most rapidly varying       1                  */
                             /* intermediate               2 (=imap[2]*2)     */
                             /* most slowly varying        6 (=imap[1]*3)     */

   Using the imap vector above with nc_put_varm_float obtains the same
result as simply using nc_put_var_float.

   Here is an example of using nc_put_varm_float to write - from a
transposed, internal array - a netCDF variable named rh which is
described by the C declaration float rh[6][4] (note the size and order
of the dimensions):

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     #define NDIM 2               /* rank of netCDF variable */
     int ncid;                    /* netCDF ID */
     int status;                  /* error status */
     int rhid;                    /* variable ID */
     static size_t start[NDIM]    /* netCDF variable start point: */
                      = {0, 0};   /* first element */
     static size_t count[NDIM]    /* size of internal array: entire netCDF */
                      = {6, 4};   /* variable; order corresponds to netCDF */
                                  /* variable -- not internal array */
     static ptrdiff_t stride[NDIM]/* variable subsampling intervals: */
                      = {1, 1};   /* sample every netCDF element */
     static ptrdiff_t imap[NDIM]  /* internal array inter-element distances; */
                      = {1, 6};   /* would be {4, 1} if not transposing */
     float rh[4][6];              /* note transposition of netCDF variable */
                                  /* dimensions */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", &rhid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_put_varm_float(ncid, rhid, start, count, stride, imap, rh);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

   Here is another example of using nc_put_varm_float to write - from a
transposed, internal array - a subsample of the same netCDF variable,
by writing every other point of the netCDF variable:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     #define NDIM 2                /* rank of netCDF variable */
     int ncid;                     /* netCDF ID */
     int status;                   /* error status */
     int rhid;                     /* variable ID */
     static size_t start[NDIM]     /* netCDF variable start point: */
                      = {0, 0};    /* first element */
     static size_t count[NDIM]     /* size of internal array: entire */
                        = {3, 2};  /* (subsampled) netCDF variable; order of */
                                   /* dimensions corresponds to netCDF */
                                   /* variable -- not internal array */
     static ptrdiff_t stride[NDIM] /* variable subsampling intervals: */
                      = {2, 2};    /* sample every other netCDF element */
     static ptrdiff_t imap[NDIM]   /* internal array inter-element distances; */
                      = {1, 3};    /* would be {2, 1} if not transposing */
     float rh[2][3];               /* note transposition of (subsampled) */
                                   /* netCDF variable dimensions */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", &rhid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_put_varm_float(ncid, rhid, start, count, stride, imap, rh);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

4.11 Read a Single Data Value: nc_get_var1_ TYPE
================================================

The functions nc_get_var1_ TYPE get a single data value from a variable
of an open netCDF dataset that is in data mode. Inputs are the netCDF
ID, the variable ID, a multidimensional index that specifies which
value to get, and the address of a location into which the data value
will be read. The value is converted from the external data type of the
variable, if necessary.

Usage
=====

     int nc_get_var1_text  (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            char *tp);
     int nc_get_var1_uchar (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            unsigned char *up);
     int nc_get_var1_schar (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            signed char *cp);
     int nc_get_var1_short (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            short *sp);
     int nc_get_var1_int   (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            int *ip);
     int nc_get_var1_long  (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            long *lp);
     int nc_get_var1_float (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            float *fp);
     int nc_get_var1_double(int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            double *dp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`index[]'
     The index of the data value to be read. The indices are relative to
     0, so for example, the first data value of a two-dimensional
     variable would have index (0,0). The elements of index must
     correspond to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the variable is
     a record variable, the first index is the record number.

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to the location into which the data value is read. If the
     type of data value differs from the netCDF variable type, type
     conversion will occur. *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type
     Conversion.


Errors
======

nc_get_var1_ TYPE returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified indices were out of range for the rank of the
     specified variable. For example, a negative index or an index that
     is larger than the corresponding dimension length will cause an
     error.

   * The value is out of the range of values representable by the
     desired data type.

   * The specified netCDF is in define mode rather than data mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_get_var1_double to get the (1,2,3) element
of the variable named rh in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc.
For simplicity in this example, we assume that we know that rh is
dimensioned with time, lat, and lon, so we want to get the value of rh
that corresponds to the second time value, the third lat value, and the
fourth lon value:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;                           /* error status */
     int ncid;                              /* netCDF ID */
     int rh_id;                             /* variable ID */
     static size_t rh_index[] = {1, 2, 3};  /* where to get value from */
     double rh_val;                         /* where to put it */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_NOWRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid, "rh", &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_get_var1_double(ncid, rh_id, rh_index, &rh_val);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

4.12 Read an Entire Variable nc_get_var_ TYPE
=============================================

The members of the nc_get_var_ TYPE family of functions read all the
values from a netCDF variable of an open netCDF dataset. This is the
simplest interface to use for reading the value of a scalar variable or
when all the values of a multidimensional variable can be read at once.
The values are read into consecutive locations with the last dimension
varying fastest. The netCDF dataset must be in data mode.

   Take care when using the simplest forms of this interface with record
variables when you don't specify how many records are to be read. If
you try to read all the values of a record variable into an array but
there are more records in the file than you assume, more data will be
read than you expect, which may cause a segmentation violation.

Usage

     int nc_get_var_text  (int ncid, int varid, char *tp);

4.13 Read an Array of Values: nc_get_vara_ TYPE
===============================================

The members of the nc_get_vara_ TYPE family of functions read an array
of values from a netCDF variable of an open netCDF dataset. The array
is specified by giving a corner and a vector of edge lengths. The
values are read into consecutive locations with the last dimension
varying fastest. The netCDF dataset must be in data mode.

Usage

     int nc_get_vara_text  (int ncid, int varid, const size_t start[],

                            const size_t count[] double *dp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`start'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the index in the variable
     where the first of the data values will be read. The indices are
     relative to 0, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (0, 0, ... , 0). The length of start must be the
     same as the number of dimensions of the specified variable. The
     elements of start correspond, in order, to the variable's
     dimensions. Hence, if the variable is a record variable, the first
     index would correspond to the starting record number for reading
     the data values.

`count'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the edge lengths along each
     dimension of the block of data values to be read. To read a single
     value, for example, specify count as (1, 1, ... , 1). The length of
     count is the number of dimensions of the specified variable. The
     elements of count correspond, in order, to the variable's
     dimensions. Hence, if the variable is a record variable, the first
     element of count corresponds to a count of the number of records to
     read.

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to the location into which the data value is read. If the
     type of data value differs from the netCDF variable type, type
     conversion will occur. *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type
     Conversion.


Errors
======

nc_get_vara_ TYPE returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified corner indices were out of range for the rank of the
     specified variable. For example, a negative index or an index that
     is larger than the corresponding dimension length will cause an
     error.

   * The specified edge lengths added to the specified corner would have
     referenced data out of range for the rank of the specified
     variable. For example, an edge length that is larger than the
     corresponding dimension length minus the corner index will cause an
     error.

   * One or more of the values are out of the range of values
     representable by the desired type.

   * The specified netCDF is in define mode rather than data mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

4.14 Read a Subsampled Array of Values: nc_get_vars_ TYPE
=========================================================

The nc_get_vars_ TYPE family of functions read a subsampled (strided)
array section of values from a netCDF variable of an open netCDF

a vector of edge lengths, and a stride vector. The values are read with
the last dimension of the netCDF variable varying fastest. The netCDF

                            double *dp)

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`start'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the index in the variable
     where the first of the data values will be read. The indices are
     relative to 0, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (0, 0, ... , 0). The elements of start
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first index corresponds to the
     starting record number for reading the data values.

`count'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the number of indices
     selected along each dimension. To read a single value, for
     example, specify count as (1, 1, ... , 1). The elements of count
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first element of count
     corresponds to a count of the number of records to read.

`stride'
     A vector of ptrdiff_t integers specifying, for each dimension, the
     interval between selected indices. The elements of the stride
     vector correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. A value
     of 1 accesses adjacent values of the netCDF variable in the
     corresponding dimension; a value of 2 accesses every other value
     of the netCDF variable in the corresponding dimension; and so on.
     A NULL stride argument is treated as (1, 1, ... , 1).

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to the location into which the data value is read. If the
     type of data value differs from the netCDF variable type, type
     conversion will occur. *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type
     Conversion.


Errors
======

nc_get_vars_ TYPE returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified start, count and stride generate an index which is
     out of range.

   * One or more of the values are out of the range of values
     representable by the desired type.

   * The specified netCDF is in define mode rather than data mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example that uses nc_get_vars_double to read every other
value in each dimension of the variable named rh from an existing
netCDF dataset named foo.nc. For simplicity in this example, we assume
that we know that rh is dimensioned with time, lat, and lon, and that
there are three time values, five lat values, and ten lon values.

     #include <netcdf.h>

     int  status;                          /* error status */
     int ncid;                             /* netCDF ID */
     int rh_id;                            /* variable ID */
     static size_t start[] = {0, 0, 0};    /* start at first value */
     static size_t count[] = {TIMES, LATS, LONS};
     static ptrdiff_t stride[] = {2, 2, 2};/* every other value */
     double data[TIMES][LATS][LONS];       /* array to hold values */
      ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_NOWRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
      ...
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid, "rh", &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
      ...
     /* read subsampled values from netCDF variable into array */
     status = nc_get_vars_double(ncid, rh_id, start, count, stride,
                                 &data[0][0][0]);

4.15 Read a Mapped Array of Values: nc_get_varm_ TYPE
=====================================================

The nc_get_varm_ TYPE family of functions reads a mapped array section
of values from a netCDF variable of an open netCDF dataset. The mapped
array section is specified by giving a corner, a vector of edge
lengths, a stride vector, and an index mapping vector. The index
mapping vector is a vector of integers that specifies the mapping
between the dimensions of a netCDF variable and the in-memory structure
of the internal data array. No assumptions are made about the ordering
or length of the dimensions of the data array. The netCDF dataset must
be in data mode.

Usage

                            const ptrdiff_t imap[], double *dp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`start'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the index in the variable
     where the first of the data values will be read. The indices are
     relative to 0, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (0, 0, ... , 0). The elements of start
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first index corresponds to the
     starting record number for reading the data values.

`count'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the number of indices
     selected along each dimension. To read a single value, for
     example, specify count as (1, 1, ... , 1). The elements of count
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first element of count
     corresponds to a count of the number of records to read.

`stride'
     A vector of ptrdiff_t integers specifying, for each dimension, the
     interval between selected indices. The elements of the stride
     vector correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. A value
     of 1 accesses adjacent values of the netCDF variable in the
     corresponding dimension; a value of 2 accesses every other value
     of the netCDF variable in the corresponding dimension; and so on.
     A NULL stride argument is treated as (1, 1, ... , 1).

`imap'
     A vector of integers that specifies the mapping between the
     dimensions of a netCDF variable and the in-memory structure of the
     internal data array. imap[0] gives the distance between elements of
     the internal array corresponding to the most slowly varying
     dimension of the netCDF variable. imap[n-1] (where n is the rank
     of the netCDF variable) gives the distance between elements of the
     internal array corresponding to the most rapidly varying dimension
     of the netCDF variable. Intervening imap elements correspond to
     other dimensions of the netCDF variable in the obvious way.
     Distances between elements are specified in type-independent units
     of elements (the distance between internal elements that occupy
     adjacent memory locations is 1 and not the element's byte-length
     as in netCDF 2).

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to the location used for computing where the data values
     are read; the data should be of the type appropriate for the
     function called. If the type of data value differs from the netCDF
     variable type, type conversion will occur. *Note Type Conversion:
     (netcdf)Type Conversion.


Errors
======

nc_get_varm_ TYPE returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified start, count, and stride generate an index which is
     out of range. Note that no error checking is possible on the imap
     vector.

   * One or more of the values are out of the range of values
     representable by the desired type.

   * The specified netCDF is in define mode rather than data mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.


Example
=======

The following imap vector maps in the trivial way a 4x3x2 netCDF
variable and an internal array of the same shape:

     float a[4][3][2];       /* same shape as netCDF variable */
     size_t imap[3] = {6, 2, 1};
                             /* netCDF dimension       inter-element distance */
                             /* ----------------       ---------------------- */
                             /* most rapidly varying       1                  */
                             /* intermediate               2 (=imap[2]*2)     */
                             /* most slowly varying        6 (=imap[1]*3)     */

   Using the imap vector above with nc_get_varm_float obtains the same
result as simply using nc_get_var_float.

   Here is an example of using nc_get_varm_float to transpose a netCDF
variable named rh which is described by the C declaration float
rh[6][4] (note the size and order of the dimensions):

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     #define NDIM 2                /* rank of netCDF variable */
     int ncid;                     /* netCDF ID */
     int status;                   /* error status */
     int rhid;                     /* variable ID */
     static size_t start[NDIM]     /* netCDF variable start point: */
                      = {0, 0};    /* first element */
     static size_t count[NDIM]     /* size of internal array: entire netCDF */
                      = {6, 4};    /* variable; order corresponds to netCDF */
                                   /* variable -- not internal array */
     static ptrdiff_t stride[NDIM] /* variable subsampling intervals: */
                      = {1, 1};    /* sample every netCDF element */
     static ptrdiff_t imap[NDIM]   /* internal array inter-element distances; */
                      = {1, 6};    /* would be {4, 1} if not transposing */
     float rh[4][6];               /* note transposition of netCDF variable */
                                   /* dimensions */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", &rhid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_get_varm_float(ncid, rhid, start, count, stride, imap, rh);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

   Here is another example of using nc_get_varm_float to simultaneously
transpose and subsample the same netCDF variable, by accessing every
other point of the netCDF variable:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     #define NDIM 2               /* rank of netCDF variable */
     int ncid;                    /* netCDF ID */
     int status;                  /* error status */
     int rhid;                    /* variable ID */
     static size_t start[NDIM]    /* netCDF variable start point: */
                      = {0, 0};   /* first element */
     static size_t count[NDIM]    /* size of internal array: entire */
                        = {3, 2}; /* (subsampled) netCDF variable; order of */
                                  /* dimensions corresponds to netCDF */
                                  /* variable -- not internal array */
     static ptrdiff_t stride[NDIM]/* variable subsampling intervals: */
                      = {2, 2};   /* sample every other netCDF element */
     static ptrdiff_t imap[NDIM]  /* internal array inter-element distances; */
                      = {1, 3};   /* would be {2, 1} if not transposing */
     float rh[2][3];              /* note transposition of (subsampled) */
                                  /* netCDF variable dimensions */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", &rhid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_get_varm_float(ncid, rhid, start, count, stride, imap, rh);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

4.16 Reading and Writing Character String Values
================================================

Character strings are not a primitive netCDF external data type, in
part because FORTRAN does not support the abstraction of
variable-length character strings (the FORTRAN LEN function returns the
static length of a character string, not its dynamic length). As a
result, a character string cannot be written or read as a single object
in the netCDF interface. Instead, a character string must be treated as
an array of characters, and array access must be used to read and write
character strings as variable data in netCDF datasets. Furthermore,
variable-length strings are not supported by the netCDF interface
except by convention; for example, you may treat a zero byte as
terminating a character string, but you must explicitly specify the
length of strings to be read from and written to netCDF variables.

   Character strings as attribute values are easier to use, since the
strings are treated as a single unit for access. However, the value of
a character-string attribute is still an array of characters with an
explicit length that must be specified when the attribute is defined.

   When you define a variable that will have character-string values,
use a character-position dimension as the most quickly varying dimension
for the variable (the last dimension for the variable in C). The length
of the character-position dimension will be the maximum string length
of any value to be stored in the character-string variable. Space for
maximum-length strings will be allocated in the disk representation of
character-string variables whether you use the space or not. If two or
more variables have the same maximum length, the same
character-position dimension may be used in defining the variable
shapes.

   To write a character-string value into a character-string variable,
use either entire variable access or array access. The latter requires
that you specify both a corner and a vector of edge lengths. The
character-position dimension at the corner should be zero for C. If the
length of the string to be written is n, then the vector of edge
lengths will specify n in the character-position dimension, and one for
all the other dimensions:(1, 1, ... , 1, n).

   In C, fixed-length strings may be written to a netCDF dataset without
the terminating zero byte, to save space. Variable-length strings
should be written with a terminating zero byte so that the intended
length of the string can be determined when it is later read.

   Here is an example that defines a record variable, tx, for character
strings and stores a character-string value into the third record using
nc_put_vara_text. In this example, we assume the string variable and
data are to be added to an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc that
already has an unlimited record dimension time.

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  ncid;            /* netCDF ID */
     int  chid;            /* dimension ID for char positions */
     int  timeid;          /* dimension ID for record dimension */
     int  tx_id;           /* variable ID */
     #define TDIMS 2       /* rank of tx variable */
     int tx_dims[TDIMS];   /* variable shape */
     size_t tx_start[TDIMS];
     size_t tx_count[TDIMS];
     static char tx_val[] =
             "example string"; /* string to be put */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_redef(ncid);       /* enter define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     /* define character-position dimension for strings of max length 40 */
     status = nc_def_dim(ncid, "chid", 40L, &chid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     /* define a character-string variable */
     tx_dims[0] = timeid;
     tx_dims[1] = chid;    /* character-position dimension last */
     status = nc_def_var (ncid, "tx", NC_CHAR, TDIMS, tx_dims, &tx_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_enddef(ncid);       /* leave define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     /* write tx_val into tx netCDF variable in record 3 */
     tx_start[0] = 3;      /* record number to write */
     tx_start[1] = 0;      /* start at beginning of variable */
     tx_count[0] = 1;      /* only write one record */
     tx_count[1] = strlen(tx_val) + 1;  /* number of chars to write */
     status = nc_put_vara_text(ncid, tx_id, tx_start, tx_count, tx_val);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

4.17 Fill Values
================

What happens when you try to read a value that was never written in an
open netCDF dataset? You might expect that this should always be an
error, and that you should get an error message or an error status
returned. You do get an error if you try to read data from a netCDF
dataset that is not open for reading, if the variable ID is invalid for
the specified netCDF dataset, or if the specified indices are not
properly within the range defined by the dimension lengths of the
specified variable. Otherwise, reading a value that was not written
returns a special fill value used to fill in any undefined values when
a netCDF variable is first written.

   You may ignore fill values and use the entire range of a netCDF
external data type, but in this case you should make sure you write all
data values before reading them. If you know you will be writing all
the data before reading it, you can specify that no prefilling of
variables with fill values will occur by calling nc_set_fill before
writing. This may provide a significant performance gain for netCDF
writes.

   The variable attribute _FillValue may be used to specify the fill
value for a variable. Their are default fill values for each type,
defined in the include file netcdf.h: NC_FILL_CHAR, NC_FILL_BYTE,
NC_FILL_SHORT, NC_FILL_INT, NC_FILL_FLOAT, and NC_FILL_DOUBLE.

   The netCDF byte and character types have different default fill
values. The default fill value for characters is the zero byte, a
useful value for detecting the end of variable-length C character
strings. If you need a fill value for a byte variable, it is
recommended that you explicitly define an appropriate _FillValue
attribute, as generic utilities such as ncdump will not assume a
default fill value for byte variables.

   Type conversion for fill values is identical to type conversion for
other values: attempting to convert a value from one type to another
type that can't represent the value results in a range error. Such
errors may occur on writing or reading values from a larger type (such
as double) to a smaller type (such as float), if the fill value for the
larger type cannot be represented in the smaller type.

4.18 Rename a Variable: nc_rename_var
=====================================

The function nc_rename_var changes the name of a netCDF variable in an
open netCDF dataset. If the new name is longer than the old name, the
netCDF dataset must be in define mode. You cannot rename a variable to
have the name of any existing variable.

Usage

int nc_rename_var(int ncid, int varid, const char* name);

   ncid  NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

   varid  Variable ID.

   name  New name for the specified variable.

Errors
======

nc_rename_var returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   The new name is in use as the name of another variable.  The
variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.  The specified
netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_rename_var to rename the variable rh to
rel_hum in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;              /* error status */
     int  ncid;                /* netCDF ID */
     int  rh_id;               /* variable ID */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_redef(ncid);  /* put in define mode to rename variable */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid, "rh", &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_rename_var (ncid, rh_id, "rel_hum");
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_enddef(ncid); /* leave define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

5.1 Introduction
================

Attributes may be associated with each netCDF variable to specify such
properties as units, special values, maximum and minimum valid values,
scaling factors, and offsets. Attributes for a netCDF dataset are
defined when the dataset is first created, while the netCDF dataset is
in define mode. Additional attributes may be added later by reentering
define mode. A netCDF attribute has a netCDF variable to which it is
assigned, a name, a type, a length, and a sequence of one or more
values. An attribute is designated by its variable ID and name. When an
attribute name is not known, it may be designated by its variable ID
and number in order to determine its name, using the function
nc_inq_attname.

   The attributes associated with a variable are typically defined
immediately after the variable is created, while still in define mode.
The data type, length, and value of an attribute may be changed even
when in data mode, as long as the changed attribute requires no more
space than the attribute as originally defined.

   It is also possible to have attributes that are not associated with
any variable. These are called global attributes and are identified by
using NC_GLOBAL as a variable pseudo-ID. Global attributes are usually
related to the netCDF dataset as a whole and may be used for purposes
such as providing a title or processing history for a netCDF dataset.

   Operations supported on attributes are:
   * Create an attribute, given its variable ID, name, data type,
     length, and value.

   * Get attribute's data type and length from its variable ID and name.

   * Get attribute's value from its variable ID and name.

   * Copy attribute from one netCDF variable to another.

   * Get name of attribute from its number.

   * Rename an attribute.

   * Delete an attribute.

5.2 Create an Attribute: nc_put_att_ TYPE
=========================================

The function nc_put_att_ TYPE adds or changes a variable attribute or
global attribute of an open netCDF dataset. If this attribute is new,
or if the space required to store the attribute is greater than before,
the netCDF dataset must be in define mode.

Usage
=====

Although it's possible to create attributes of all types, text and
double attributes are adequate for most purposes.

     int nc_put_att_text   (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                                           size_t len, const char *tp);
     int nc_put_att_uchar  (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                               nc_type xtype, size_t len, const unsigned char *up);
     int nc_put_att_schar  (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                               nc_type xtype, size_t len, const signed char *cp);
     int nc_put_att_short  (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            nc_type xtype, size_t len, const short *sp);
     int nc_put_att_int    (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            nc_type xtype, size_t len, const int *ip);
     int nc_put_att_long   (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            nc_type xtype, size_t len, const long *lp);
     int nc_put_att_float  (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            nc_type xtype, size_t len, const float *fp);
     int nc_put_att_double (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            nc_type xtype, size_t len, const double *dp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID of the variable to which the attribute will be
     assigned or NC_GLOBAL for a global attribute.

`name'
     Attribute name. Must begin with an alphabetic character, followed
     by zero or more alphanumeric characters including the underscore
     ('_'). Case is significant. Attribute name conventions are assumed
     by some netCDF generic applications, e.g., units as the name for a
     string attribute that gives the units for a netCDF variable. For
     examples of attribute conventions see *Note Attribute Conventions:
     (netcdf)Attribute Conventions.

`xtype'
     One of the set of predefined netCDF external data types. The type
     of this parameter, nc_type, is defined in the netCDF header file.
     The valid netCDF external data types are NC_BYTE, NC_CHAR,
     NC_SHORT, NC_INT, NC_FLOAT, and NC_DOUBLE. Although it's possible
     to create attributes of all types, NC_CHAR and NC_DOUBLE
     attributes are adequate for most purposes.

`len'
     Number of values provided for the attribute.

`tp, up, cp, sp, ip, lp, fp, or dp'
     Pointer to one or more values. If the type of values differs from
     the netCDF attribute type specified as xtype, type conversion will
     occur. *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type Conversion.

Errors
======

nc_put_att_ TYPE returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF type is invalid.

   * The specified length is negative.

   * The specified open netCDF dataset is in data mode and the specified
     attribute would expand.

   * The specified open netCDF dataset is in data mode and the specified
     attribute does not already exist.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * The number of attributes for this variable exceeds NC_MAX_ATTRS.


Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_put_att_double to add a variable attribute
named valid_range for a netCDF variable named rh and a global attribute
named title to an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;                            /* error status */
     int  ncid;                              /* netCDF ID */
     int  rh_id;                             /* variable ID */
     static double rh_range[] = {0.0, 100.0};/* attribute vals */
     static char title[] = "example netCDF dataset";
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_redef(ncid);                /* enter define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid, "rh", &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_put_att_double (ncid, rh_id, "valid_range",
                                 NC_DOUBLE, 2, rh_range);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_put_att_text (ncid, NC_GLOBAL, "title",
                               strlen(title), title)
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_enddef(ncid);               /* leave define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

5.3 Get Information about an Attribute: nc_inq_att Family
=========================================================

This family of functions returns information about a netCDF attribute.
All but one of these functions require the variable ID and attribute
name; the exception is nc_inq_attname. Information about an attribute
includes its type, length, name, and number. See the nc_get_att family
for getting attribute values.

   The function nc_inq_attname gets the name of an attribute, given its
variable ID and number. This function is useful in generic applications
that need to get the names of all the attributes associated with a
variable, since attributes are accessed by name rather than number in
all other attribute functions. The number of an attribute is more
volatile than the name, since it can change when other attributes of
the same variable are deleted. This is why an attribute number is not
called an attribute ID.

   The function nc_inq_att returns the attribute's type and length. The
other functions each return just one item of information about an
attribute.

Usage
=====

     int nc_inq_att    (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                        nc_type *xtypep, size_t *lenp);
     int nc_inq_atttype(int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                        nc_type *xtypep);
     int nc_inq_attlen  (int ncid, int varid, const char *name, size_t *lenp);
     int nc_inq_attname(int ncid, int varid, int attnum, char *name);
     int nc_inq_attid   (int ncid, int varid, const char *name, int *attnump);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID of the attribute's variable, or NC_GLOBAL for a global
     attribute.

`name'
     Attribute name. For nc_inq_attname, this is a pointer to the
     location for the returned attribute name.

`xtypep'
     Pointer to location for returned attribute type, one of the set of
     predefined netCDF external data types. The type of this parameter,
     nc_type, is defined in the netCDF header file. The valid netCDF
     external data types are NC_BYTE, NC_CHAR, NC_SHORT, NC_INT,
     NC_FLOAT, and NC_DOUBLE. If this parameter is given as '0' (a null
     pointer), no type will be returned so no variable to hold the type
     needs to be declared.

`lenp'
     Pointer to location for returned number of values currently stored
     in the attribute. For attributes of type NC_CHAR, you should not
     assume that this includes a trailing zero byte; it doesn't if the
     attribute was stored without a trailing zero byte, for example
     from a FORTRAN program. Before using the value as a C string, make
     sure it is null-terminated. If this parameter is given as '0' (a
     null pointer), no length will be returned so no variable to hold
     this information needs to be declared.

`attnum'
     For nc_inq_attname, attribute number. The attributes for each
     variable are numbered from 0 (the first attribute) to natts-1,
     where natts is the number of attributes for the variable, as
     returned from a call to nc_inq_varnatts.

`attnump'
     For nc_inq_attid, pointer to location for returned attribute number
     that specifies which attribute this is for this variable (or which
     global attribute). If you already know the attribute name, knowing
     its number is not very useful, because accessing information about
     an attribute requires its name.


Errors
======

Each function returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified attribute does not exist.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * For nc_inq_attname, the specified attribute number is negative or
     more than the number of attributes defined for the specified
     variable.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_inq_att to find out the type and length of
a variable attribute named valid_range for a netCDF variable named rh
and a global attribute named title in an existing netCDF dataset named
foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;               /* error status */
     int  ncid;                 /* netCDF ID */
     int  rh_id;                /* variable ID */
     nc_type vr_type, t_type;   /* attribute types */
     int  vr_len, t_len;        /* attribute lengths */

        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_NOWRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid, "rh", &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_att (ncid, rh_id, "valid_range", &vr_type, &vr_len);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_inq_att (ncid, NC_GLOBAL, "title", &t_type, &t_len);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

5.4 Get Attribute's Values:nc_get_att_ TYPE
===========================================

Members of the nc_get_att_ TYPE family of functions get the value(s) of
a netCDF attribute, given its variable ID and name.

Usage
=====

     int nc_get_att_text   (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            char *tp);
     int nc_get_att_uchar  (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            unsigned char *up);
     int nc_get_att_schar  (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            signed char *cp);
     int nc_get_att_short  (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            short *sp);
     int nc_get_att_int    (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            int *ip);
     int nc_get_att_long   (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            long *lp);
     int nc_get_att_float  (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            float *fp);
     int nc_get_att_double (int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                            double *dp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID of the attribute's variable, or NC_GLOBAL for a global
     attribute.

`name'
     Attribute name.

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to location for returned attribute value(s). All elements
     of the vector of attribute values are returned, so you must
     allocate enough space to hold them. For attributes of type
     NC_CHAR, you should not assume that the returned values include a
     trailing zero byte; they won't if the attribute was stored without
     a trailing zero byte, for example from a FORTRAN program. Before
     using the value as a C string, make sure it is null-terminated. If
     you don't know how much space to reserve, call nc_inq_attlen first
     to find out the length of the attribute.


Errors
======

nc_get_att_ TYPE returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified attribute does not exist.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * One or more of the attribute values are out of the range of values
     representable by the desired type.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_get_att_double to determine the values of a
variable attribute named valid_range for a netCDF variable named rh and
a global attribute named title in an existing netCDF dataset named
foo.nc. In this example, it is assumed that we don't know how many
values will be returned, but that we do know the types of the
attributes. Hence, to allocate enough space to store them, we must
first inquire about the length of the attributes.

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;               /* error status */

5.5 Copy Attribute from One NetCDF to Another: nc_copy_att
==========================================================

The function nc_copy_att copies an attribute from one open netCDF
dataset to another. It can also be used to copy an attribute from one
variable to another within the same netCDF.

Usage
=====

     int nc_copy_att (int ncid_in, int varid_in, const char *name,
                      int ncid_out, int varid_out);

`ncid_in'
     The netCDF ID of an input netCDF dataset from which the attribute
     will be copied, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid_in'
     ID of the variable in the input netCDF dataset from which the
     attribute will be copied, or NC_GLOBAL for a global attribute.

`name'
     Name of the attribute in the input netCDF dataset to be copied.

`ncid_out'
     The netCDF ID of the output netCDF dataset to which the attribute
     will be copied, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create. It is
     permissible for the input and output netCDF IDs to be the same. The
     output netCDF dataset should be in define mode if the attribute to
     be copied does not already exist for the target variable, or if it
     would cause an existing target attribute to grow.

`varid_out'
     ID of the variable in the output netCDF dataset to which the
     attribute will be copied, or NC_GLOBAL to copy to a global
     attribute.

Errors
======

nc_copy_att returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The input or output variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF
     dataset.

   * The specified attribute does not exist.

   * The output netCDF is not in define mode and the attribute is new
     for the output dataset is larger than the existing attribute.

   * The input or output netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF
     dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_copy_att to copy the variable attribute
units from the variable rh in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc
to the variable avgrh in another existing netCDF dataset named bar.nc,
assuming that the variable avgrh already exists, but does not yet have
a units attribute:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;               /* error status */
     int  ncid1, ncid2;         /* netCDF IDs */
     int  rh_id, avgrh_id;      /* variable IDs */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_NOWRITE, ncid1);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_open("bar.nc", NC_WRITE, ncid2);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid1, "rh", &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid2, "avgrh", &avgrh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_redef(ncid2);  /* enter define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     /* copy variable attribute from "rh" to "avgrh" */
     status = nc_copy_att(ncid1, rh_id, "units", ncid2, avgrh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...

5.6 Rename an Attribute: nc_rename_att
======================================

The function nc_rename_att changes the name of an attribute. If the new
name is longer than the original name, the netCDF dataset must be in
define mode. You cannot rename an attribute to have the same name as
another attribute of the same variable.

Usage
=====

     int nc_rename_att (int ncid, int varid, const char* name,
                        const char* newname);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create

`varid'
     ID of the attribute's variable, or NC_GLOBAL for a global attribute

`name'
     The current attribute name.

`newname'
     The new name to be assigned to the specified attribute. If the new
     name is longer than the current name, the netCDF dataset must be in
     define mode.

Errors
======

nc_rename_att returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The specified variable ID is not valid.

   * The new attribute name is already in use for another attribute of
     the specified variable.

   * The specified netCDF dataset is in data mode and the new name is
     longer than the old name.

   * The specified attribute does not exist.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_rename_att to rename the variable attribute
units to Units for a variable rh in an existing netCDF dataset named
foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;      /* error status */
     int  ncid;        /* netCDF ID */
     int  rh_id;       /* variable id */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_NOWRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid, "rh", &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     /* rename attribute */
     status = nc_rename_att(ncid, rh_id, "units", "Units");
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

5.7 Delete an Attribute: nc_del_att
===================================

The function nc_del_att deletes a netCDF attribute from an open netCDF
dataset. The netCDF dataset must be in define mode.

Usage
=====

int nc_del_att (int ncid, int varid, const char* name);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     ID of the attribute's variable, or NC_GLOBAL for a global
     attribute.

`name'
     The name of the attribute to be deleted.

Errors
======

nc_del_att returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:

   * The specified variable ID is not valid.

   * The specified netCDF dataset is in data mode.

   * The specified attribute does not exist.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_del_att to delete the variable attribute
Units for a variable rh in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;      /* error status */
     int  ncid;        /* netCDF ID */
     int  rh_id;       /* variable ID */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid, "rh", &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     /* delete attribute */
     status = nc_redef(ncid);        /* enter define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_del_att(ncid, rh_id, "Units");
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_enddef(ncid);       /* leave define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

Appendix B NetCDF 2 C Transition Guide
**************************************

B.1 Overview of C interface changes
===================================

NetCDF version 3 includes a complete rewrite of the netCDF library. It
is about twice as fast as the previous version. The netCDF file format
is unchanged, so files written with version 3 can be read with version
2 code and vice versa.

   The core library is now written in ANSI C. For example, prototypes
are used throughout as well as const qualifiers where appropriate. You
must have an ANSI C compiler to compile this version.

   Rewriting the library offered an opportunity to implement improved C
and FORTRAN interfaces that provide some significant benefits:

   type safety, by eliminating the need to use generic void* pointers;

   automatic type conversions, by eliminating the undesirable coupling
between the language-independent external netCDF types (NC_BYTE, ...,
NC_DOUBLE) and language-dependent internal data types (char, ...,
double);

   support for future enhancements, by eliminating obstacles to the
clean addition of support for packed data and multithreading;

   more standard error behavior, by uniformly communicating an error
status back to the calling program in the return value of each function.

   It is not necessary to rewrite programs that use the version 2 C
interface, because the netCDF-3 library includes a backward
compatibility interface that supports all the old functions, globals,
and behavior. We are hoping that the benefits of the new interface will
be an incentive to use it in new netCDF applications. It is possible to
convert old applications to the new interface incrementally, replacing
netCDF-2 calls with the corresponding netCDF-3 calls one at a time. If
you want to check that only netCDF-3 calls are used in an application,
a preprocessor macro (NO_NETCDF_2) is available for that purpose.

   Other changes in the implementation of netCDF result in improved
portability, maintainability, and performance on most platforms. A
clean separation between I/O and type layers facilitates
platform-specific optimizations. The new library no longer uses a
vendor-provided XDR library, which simplifies linking programs that use
netCDF and speeds up data access significantly in most cases.

B.2 The New C Interface
=======================

First, here's an example of C code that uses the netCDF-2 interface:

     void *bufferp;
     nc_type xtype;
     ncvarinq(ncid, varid, ..., &xtype, ...
     ...
     /* allocate bufferp based on dimensions and type */
     ...
     if (ncvarget(ncid, varid, start, count, bufferp) == -1) {
         fprintf(stderr, "Can't get data, error code = %d\n",ncerr);
         /* deal with it */
         ...
     }
     switch(xtype) {
         /* deal with the data, according to type */
     ...
     case  NC_FLOAT:
         fanalyze((float *)bufferp);
         break;
     case NC_DOUBLE:
         danalyze((double *)bufferp);
         break;
     }

   Here's how you might handle this with the new netCDF-3 C interface:

     /*
      * I want to use doubles for my analysis.
      */
     double dbuf[NDOUBLES];
     int status;

     /* So, I use the function that gets the data as doubles. */
     status = nc_get_vara_double(ncid, varid, start, count, dbuf)
     if (status != NC_NOERR) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Can't get data: %s\n", nc_strerror(status));
         /* deal with it */
         ...
     }
     danalyze(dbuf);

   The example above illustrates changes in function names, data type
conversion, and error handling, discussed in detail in the sections
below.

B.3 Function Naming Conventions
===============================

The netCDF-3 C library employs a new naming convention, intended to
make netCDF programs more readable. For example, the name of the
function to rename a variable is now nc_rename_var instead of the
previous ncvarrename.

   All netCDF-3 C function names begin with the nc_ prefix. The second
part of the name is a verb, like get, put, inq (for inquire), or open.
The third part of the name is typically the object of the verb: for
example dim, var, or att for functions dealing with dimensions,
variables, or attributes. To distinguish the various I/O operations for
variables, a single character modifier is appended to var:

   var entire variable access var1 single value access vara array or
array section access vars strided access to a subsample of values varm
mapped access to values not contiguous in memory

   At the end of the name for variable and attribute functions, there is
a component indicating the type of the final argument: text, uchar,
schar, short, int, long, float, or double. This part of the function
name indicates the type of the data container you are using in your
program: character string, unsigned char, signed char, and so on.

   Also, all macro names in the public C interface begin with the prefix
NC_. For example, the macro which was formerly MAX_NC_NAME is now
NC_MAX_NAME, and the former FILL_FLOAT is now NC_FILL_FLOAT.

   As previously mentioned, all the old names are still supported for
backward compatibility.

B.4 Type Conversion
===================

With the new interface, users need not be aware of the external type of
numeric variables, since automatic conversion to or from any desired
numeric type is now available. You can use this feature to simplify
code, by making it independent of external types. The elimination of
void* pointers provides detection of type errors at compile time that
could not be detected with the previous interface. Programs may be made
more robust with the new interface, because they need not be changed to
accommodate a change to the external type of a variable.

   If conversion to or from an external numeric type is necessary, it is
handled by the library. This automatic conversion and separation of
external data representation from internal data types will become even
more important in netCDF version 4, when new external types will be
added for packed data for which there is no natural corresponding
internal type, for example, arrays of 11-bit values.

   Converting from one numeric type to another may result in an error if
the target type is not capable of representing the converted value. (In
netCDF-2, such overflows can only happen in the XDR layer.)  For
example, a float may not be able to hold data stored externally as an
NC_DOUBLE (an IEEE floating-point number). When accessing an array of
values, an NC_ERANGE error is returned if one or more values are out of
the range of representable values, but other values are converted
properly.

   Note that mere loss of precision in type conversion does not return
an error. Thus, if you read double precision values into an int, for
example, no error results unless the magnitude of the double precision
value exceeds the representable range of ints on your platform.
Similarly, if you read a large integer into a float incapable of
representing all the bits of the integer in its mantissa, this loss of
precision will not result in an error. If you want to avoid such
precision loss, check the external types of the variables you access to
make sure you use an internal type that has a compatible precision.

   The new interface distinguishes arrays of characters intended to
represent text strings from arrays of 8-bit bytes intended to represent
small integers. The interface supports the internal types text, uchar,
and schar, intended for text strings, unsigned byte values, and signed
byte values.

   The _uchar and _schar functions were introduced in netCDF-3 to
eliminate an ambiguity, and support both signed and unsigned byte data.
In netCDF-2, whether the external NC_BYTE type represented signed or
unsigned values was left up to the user. In netcdf-3, we treat NC_BYTE
as signed for the purposes of conversion to short, int, long, float, or
double. (Of course, no conversion takes place when the internal type is
signed char.) In the _uchar functions, we treat NC_BYTE as if it were
unsigned. Thus, no NC_ERANGE error can occur converting between NC_BYTE
and unsigned char.

B.5 Error handling
==================

The new interface handles errors differently than netCDF-2. In the old
interface, the default behavior when an error was detected was to print
an error message and exit. To get control of error handling, you had to
set flag bits in a global variable, ncopts, and to determine the cause
of an error, you had to test the value of another global variable ncerr.

   In the new interface, functions return an integer status that
indicates not only success or failure, but also the cause of the error.
The global variables ncerr and ncopt have been eliminated. The library
will never try to print anything, nor will it call exit (unless you are
using the netCDF version 2 compatibility functions). You will have to
check the function return status and do this yourself. We eliminated
these globals in the interest of supporting parallel (multiprocessor)
execution cleanly, as well as reducing the number of assumptions about
the environment where netCDF is used. The new behavior should provide
better support for using netCDF as a hidden layer in applications that
have their own GUI interface.

B.6 NC_LONG and NC_INT
======================

Where the netCDF-2 interface used NC_LONG to identify an external data
type corresponding to 32-bit integers, the new interface uses NC_INT
instead. NC_LONG is defined to have the same value as NC_INT for
backward compatibility, but it should not be used in new code. With new
64-bit platforms using long for 64-bit integers, we would like to
reduce the confusion caused by this name clash. Note that there is
still no netCDF external data type corresponding to 64-bit integers.

B.7 What's Missing?
===================

The new C interface omits three "record I/O" functions, ncrecput,
ncrecget, and ncrecinq, from the netCDF-2 interface, although these
functions are still supported via the netCDF-2 compatibility interface.

   This means you may have to replace one record-oriented call with
multiple type-specific calls, one for each record variable. For
example, a single call to ncrecput can always be replaced by multiple
calls to the appropriate nc_put_var functions, one call for each
variable accessed. The record-oriented functions were omitted, because
there is no simple way to provide type-safety and automatic type
conversion for such an interface.

   There is no function corresponding to the nctypelen function from the
version 2 interface. The separation of internal and external types and
the new type-conversion interfaces make nctypelen unnecessary. Since
users read into and write out of native types, the sizeof operator is
perfectly adequate to determine how much space to allocate for a value.

   In the previous library, there was no checking that the characters
used in the name of a netCDF object were compatible with CDL
restrictions. The ncdump and ncgen utilities that use CDL permit only
alphanumeric characters, "_" and "-" in names. Now this restriction is
also enforced by the library for creation of new dimensions, variables,
and attributes. Previously existing components with less restrictive
names will still work OK.

B.8 Other Changes
=================

There are two new functions in netCDF-3 that don't correspond to any
netCDF-2 functions: nc_inq_libvers and nc_strerror. The version of the
netCDF library in use is returned as a string by nc_inq_libvers. An
error message corresponding to the status returned by a netCDF function
call is returned as a string by the nc_strerror function.

   A new NC_SHARE flag is available for use in an nc_open or nc_create
call, to suppress the default buffering of accesses. The use of
NC_SHARE for concurrent access to a netCDF dataset means you don't have
to call nc_sync after every access to make sure that disk updates are
synchronous. It is important to note that changes to ancillary data,
such as attribute values, are not propagated automatically by use of
the NC_SHARE flag. Use of the nc_sync function is still required for
this purpose.

   The version 2 interface had a single inquiry function, ncvarinq for
getting the name, type, and shape of a variable. Similarly, only a
single inquiry function was available for getting information about a
dimension, an attribute, or a netCDF dataset. When you only wanted a
subset of this information, you had to provide NULL arguments as
placeholders for the unneeded information. The new interface includes
additional inquire functions that return each item separately, so
errors are less likely from miscounting arguments.

   The previous implementation returned an error when 0-valued count
components were specified in ncvarput and ncvarget calls. This
restriction has been removed, so that now functions in the nc_put_var
and nc_get_var families may be called with 0-valued count components,
resulting in no data being accessed. Although this may seem useless, it
simplifies some programs to not treat 0-valued counts as a special case.

   The previous implementation returned an error when the same dimension
was used more than once in specifying the shape of a variable in
ncvardef. This restriction is relaxed in the netCDF-3 implementation,
because an autocorrelation matrix is a good example where using the
same dimension twice makes sense.

   In the new interface, units for the imap argument to the nc_put_varm
and nc_get_varm families of functions are now in terms of the number of
data elements of the desired internal type, not in terms of bytes as in
the netCDF version-2 mapped access interfaces.
